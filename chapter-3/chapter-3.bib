	abstract = {DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) offers a robust platform to decipher nucleic acid sequences. Recently, we reported a single-molecule nanopore-based SBS strategy that accurately distinguishes four bases by electronically detecting and differentiating four different polymer tags attached to the 5'-phosphate of the nucleotides during their incorporation into a growing DNA strand catalyzed by DNA polymerase. Further developing this approach, we report here the use of nucleotides tagged at the terminal phosphate with oligonucleotide-based polymers to perform nanopore SBS on an $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore array platform. We designed and synthesized several polymer-tagged nucleotides using tags that produce different electrical current blockade levels and verified they are active substrates for DNA polymerase. A highly processive DNA polymerase was conjugated to the nanopore, and the conjugates were complexed with primer/template DNA and inserted into lipid bilayers over individually addressable electrodes of the nanopore chip. When an incoming complementary-tagged nucleotide forms a tight ternary complex with the primer/template and polymerase, the tag enters the pore, and the current blockade level is measured. The levels displayed by the four nucleotides tagged with four different polymers captured in the nanopore in such ternary complexes were clearly distinguishable and sequence-specific, enabling continuous sequence determination during the polymerase reaction. Thus, real-time single-molecule electronic DNA sequencing data with single-base resolution were obtained. The use of these polymer-tagged nucleotides, combined with polymerase tethering to nanopores and multiplexed nanopore sensors, should lead to new high-throughput sequencing methods.},

	abstract = {The distribution of disordered proteins (FG-nups) that line the transport channel of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is investigated by means of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. A one-bead-per-amino-acid model is presented that accounts for the hydrophobic/hydrophilic and electrostatic interactions between different amino acids, polarity of the solvent, and screening of free ions. The results indicate that the interaction of the FG-nups forms a high-density, doughnut-like distribution inside the NPC, which is rich in FG-repeats. We show that the obtained distribution is encoded in the amino-acid sequence of the FG-nups and is driven by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. To explore the relation between structure and function, we have systematically removed different combinations of FG-nups from the pore to simulate inviable and viable NPCs that were previously studied experimentally. The obtained density distributions show that the maximum density of the FG-nups inside the pore does not exceed 185 mg/mL in the inviable NPCs, whereas for the wild-type and viable NPCs, this value increases to 300 mg/mL. Interestingly, this maximum density is not correlated to the total mass of the FG-nups, but depends sensitively on the specific combination of essential Nups located in the central plane of the NPC.},

	abstract = {Sculpting solid-state materials at the nanoscale is an important step in the manufacturing of numerous types of sensor devices, in particular solid-state nanopore sensors. Here we present mechanistic insight into laser-induced thinning of low-stress silicon nitride (SiN x ) membranes and films. In a recent study, we observed that focusing a visible wavelength laser beam on a SiN x membrane results in efficient localized heating, and we used this effect to control temperature at a solid-state nanopore sensor. A side-effect of the observed heating was that the pores expand/degrade under prolonged high-power illumination, prompting us to study the mechanism of this etching process. We find that SiN x can be etched under exposure to light of ∼10 7 W/cm 2 average intensity, with etch rates that are influenced by the supporting electrolyte. Combining this controlled etching with dielectric breakdown, an electrokinetic process for making pores, nanopores of arbitrary dimensions as small as 1-2 nm in diameter and thickness can easily be fabricated. Evidence gathered from biomolecule-pore interactions suggests that the pore geometries obtained using this method are more funnel-like, rather than hourglass-shaped. Refined control over pore dimensions can expand the range of applications of solid-state nanopores, for example, biopolymer sequencing and detection of specific biomarkers.},

The kinetics of silanization toward saturation was investigated using different solvents including water, water/ethanol (1/1), and toluene/methanol (1/1) at different reaction temperature with different APTES loading. The nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, transmission electron microscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Grafting density data based on TGA were used for the kinetic modeling. It is shown that initial silanization takes place very fast but the progress toward saturation is very slow, and the mechanism may involve adsorption, chemical sorption, and chemical diffusion processes. The highest equilibrium grafting density of 301 mg/g was yielded when using toluene/methanol mixture as the solvent at a reaction temperature of 70 °C.},

In dilute solution the behavior of DEAE‐dextran was compared with that of unsubstituted dextran and the molecular weight M dependences of the radius of gyration Rg, hydrodynamic radius Rh, intrinsic viscosity [$\eta$], second virial coefficient A2 and z‐average diffusion coefficient Dz were determined. The relationships for DEAE‐dextran dissolved in a 0,8 molar sodium nitrate solution were nearly the same as for dextran dissolved in water with 0,05 wt.‐{\%} sodium azide and gave the same exponents. The molecular weight dependence of the intrinsic viscosity cannot be described by a Kuhn‐Mark‐Houwink relationship with a constant exponent. The slope in the plot of log [$\eta$] versus log M decreases with increasing molecular weight which indicates the occurrence of branching. By means of SEC/LALLS/VISC measurements the molecular weight distributions were determined. The distributions were calculated (1) directly from the light scattering signal, (2) from a calibration line obtained by light scattering data of a DEAE‐dextran sample with a broad distribution and (3) from the intrinsic viscosity distribution obtained by the on‐line viscosity/refractive index detector in combination with the [$\eta$]‐M relationship. In order to get the correct molecular‐weight dependence of the intrinsic viscosity it is necessary to determine the molecular weight distribution directly by LALLS (technique 1) and to combine this with the appropriate intrinsic viscosity data from the viscometer. Only the third technique, which is an extension of technique 1, gave satisfactory results over the whole molecular weight region observed. {\textcopyright} 1995 H{\"{u}}thig {\&} Wepf Verlag, Zug},

Apart from extending the chemical and structural diversity presented by peptides, such modifications also increase the proteolytic stability of the molecules, enhancing their utility for biological applications.

A main ingredient for the understanding of structure/function correlates of ion channels is the quantitative description of single-channel gating and conductance. However, a wealth of information provided from fast current fluctuations beyond the temporal resolution of t he recording system is often ignored, even though it is close to the time window accessible to molecular dynamics simulations. This kind of current fluctuations provide a special technical challenge, because individual opening/closing or blocking/unblocking events cannot be resolved, and the resulting averaging over undetected events decreases the singlechannel current. Here, I briefly summarize the history of fastcurrent fluctuation analysis and focus on the so-called “beta distributions.” This tool exploits characteristics of current fluctuation-induced excess noise on the current amplitude histograms to reconstruct the true single-channel current and kinetic parameters. A guideline for the analysis and recent applications demonstrate that a construction of theoretical beta distributions by Markov Model simulations offers maximum flexibility as compared to analytical solutions.},

	abstract = {A nanopore is an analytical tool with single molecule sensitivity. For detection, a nanopore relies on the electrical signal that develops when a molecule translocates through it. However, the detection sensitivity can be adversely affected by noise and the frequency response. Here, we report measurements of the frequency and noise performance of nanopores 8 nm in diameter in membranes compatible with semiconductor processing. We find that both the high frequency and noise performance are compromised by parasitic capacitances. From the frequency response we extract the parameters of lumped element models motivated by the physical structure that elucidates the parasitics, and then we explore four strategies for improving the electrical performance. We reduce the parasitic membrane capacitances using: (1) thick Si 3 N 4 membranes; (2) miniaturized composite membranes consisting of Si 3 N 4 and polyimide; (3) miniaturized membranes formed from metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors; and (4) capacitance compensation through external circuitry, which has been used successfully for patch clamping. While capacitance compensation provides a vast improvement in the high frequency performance, mitigation of the parasitic capacitance through miniaturization offers the most promising route to high fidelity electrical discrimination of single molecules.},

In this study, GUVs of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphocholine(DOPC)/1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine(DSPC)/ cholesterol and 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine(diPhyPC)/1,2- dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine(DPPC)/cholesterol were prepared from dry lipid films using the standard electroformation method as well as a modified method from damp lipid films, which are made from compositional uniform liposomes prepared using the Rapid Solvent Exchange (RSE) method. We quantified the lipid compositional distributions of GUV by measuring the miscibility transition temperature of GUVs using fluorescence microscopy, since a narrower distribution in the transition temperature should correspond to a more uniform distribution in GUV lipid composition. Cholesterol molecules can demix from other lipids in dry state and form cholesterol crystals. Using optical microscopy, micron-sized crystals were observed in some dry lipid films. Thus, a major cause of GUV lipid compositional heterogeneity is the demixing of lipids in the dry film state. By avoiding the dry film state, GUVs prepared from damp lipid films have a better uniformity in lipid composition, and the standard deviations of miscibility transition temperature are about 2.5 times smaller than that of GUVs prepared from dry lipid films. Comparing the two ternary systems, diPhyPC/DPPC/cholesterol GUVs has a larger cholesterol compositional heterogeneity, which directly correlates with the low maximum solubility of cholesterol in diPhyPC lipid bilayers (40.2 ± 0.5 mol{\%}) measured by light scattering. Our data indicate that cholesterol interacts far less favorably with diPhyPC than it does with other PCs. The damp lipid film method also has a potential of preparing GUVs from cell membranes containing native proteins without going through a dry state. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To probe protonation dynamics inside the fully open alpha-toxin ion channel, we measured the pH-dependent fluctuations in its current. In the presence of 1 M NaCl dissolved in H2O and positive applied potentials (from the side of protein addition), the low frequency noise exhibited a single well defined peak between pH 4.5 and 7.5. A simple model in which the current is assumed to change by equal amounts upon the reversible protonation of each of N identical ionizable residues inside the channel describes the data well. These results, and the frequency dependence of the spectral density at higher frequencies, allow us to evaluate the effective pK = 5.5, as well as the rate constants for the reversible protonation reactions: kon = 8 x 10(9) M-1 s-1 and koff = 2.5 x 10(4) s-1. The estimate of kon is only slightly less than the diffusion-limited values measured by others for protonation reactions for free carboxyl or imidazole residues. Substitution of H2O by D2O caused a 3.8-fold decrease in the dissociation rate constant and shifted the pK to 6.0. The decrease in the ionization rate constants caused by H2O/D2O substitution permitted the reliable measurement of the characteristic relaxation time over a wide range of D+ concentrations and voltages. The dependence of the relaxation time on D+ concentration strongly supports the first order reaction model. The voltage dependence of the low frequency spectral density suggests that the protonation dynamics are virtually insensitive to the applied potential while the rate-limiting barriers for NaCl transport are voltage dependent. The number of ionizable residues deduced from experiments in H2O (N = 4.2) and D2O (N = 4.1) is in good agreement. {\textcopyright} 1995, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

The pore conductivity is found to be much larger than the bulk conductivity for dilute bath concentrations, where the Debye length is larger than the pore radius, whereas it is comparable with or less than the bulk for high bath concentrations. We interpret these observations by using multiscale simulations of the ion transport through the pores. Molecular dynamics is used to estimate the ion mobility, and ion transport in the pore is described by the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck and the Stokes equations that are solved self-consistently for the ion concentration and velocity and electrical potential. We find that the measurements are consistent with the presence of fixed negative charge in the pore wall and a reduction of the ion mobility because of the fixed charge and the ion proximity to the pore wall.},

Here, we probe the transport of ions and transport receptors through biomimetic NPCs consisting of Nsp1 domains attached to the inner surface of solid-state nanopores. We examine both wildtype FG-domains and hydrophilic SG-mutants. FG-nanopores showed a clear selectivity as transport receptors can translocate across the pore whereas other proteins cannot. SG mutant pores lack such selectivity. To unravel this striking difference, we present coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations that reveal that FG-pores exhibit a high-density, nonuniform protein distribution, in contrast to a uniform and significantly less-dense protein distribution in the SG-mutant. We conclude that the sequence-dependent density distribution of disordered proteins inside the NPC plays a key role for its conductivity and selective permeability.},

	abstract = {DNA origami has attracted substantial attention since its invention ten years ago, due to the seemingly infinite possibilities that it affords for creating customized nanoscale objects. Although the basic concept of DNA origami is easy to understand, using custom DNA origami in practical applications requires detailed know-how for designing and producing the particles with sufficient quality and for preparing them at appropriate concentrations with the necessary degree of purity in custom environments. Such know-how is not readily available for newcomers to the field, thus slowing down the rate at which new applications outside the field of DNA nanotechnology may emerge. To foster faster progress, we share in this article the experience in making and preparing DNA origami that we have accumulated over recent years. We discuss design solutions for creating advanced structural motifs including corners and various types of hinges that expand the design space for the more rigid multilayer DNA origami and provide guidelines for preventing undesired aggregation and on how to induce specific oligomerization of multiple DNA origami building blocks. In addition, we provide detailed protocols and discuss the expected results for five key methods that allow efficient and damage-free preparation of DNA origami. These methods are agarose-gel purification, filtration through molecular cut-off membranes, PEG precipitation, size-exclusion chromatography, and ultracentrifugation-based sedimentation. The guide for creating advanced design motifs and the detailed protocols with their experimental characterization that we describe here should lower the barrier for researchers to accomplish the full DNA origami production workflow.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. We present a novel cost-efficient method for the fabrication of high-quality self-aligned plasmonic nanopores by means of an optically controlled dielectric breakdown. Excitation of a plasmonic bowtie nanoantenna on a dielectric membrane localizes the high-voltage-driven breakdown of the membrane to the hotspot of the enhanced optical field, creating a nanopore that is automatically self-aligned to the plasmonic hotspot of the bowtie. We show that the approach provides precise control over the nanopore size and that these plasmonic nanopores can be used as single molecule DNA sensors with a performance matching that of TEM-drilled nanopores. The principle of optically controlled breakdown can also be used to fabricate nonplasmonic nanopores at a controlled position. Our novel fabrication process guarantees alignment of the nanopore with the optical hotspot of the nanoantenna, thus ensuring that pore-translocating biomolecules interact with the concentrated optical field that can be used for detection and manipulation of analytes.},

The structural details of NPCs vary across species, with many of their constituent proteins exhibiting relatively low sequence conservation; yet the NPC as a whole retains its general architecture and mechanism of action in all eukaryotes from yeast to humans. This functional conservation in the absence of precise molecular conservation suggests that many aspects of the NPC transport mechanism may be understood based on general biophysical considerations. Accordingly, some aspects of NPC function have been recapitulated in artificial nanochannel mimics, even though they lack certain molecular elements of the endogenous NPC. Herein, we review biophysical aspects of NPC architecture and function and cover recent progress in the field. We also review recent advances in man-made molecular filters inspired by NPCs, and their applications in nanotechnology. We conclude the review with an outlook on outstanding questions in the field and biomedical aspects of NPC transport.},

This is achieved by electrospinning a copolymer nanofiber mesh (NFM) directly onto a solid-state nanopore (NP) chip. The effect of NFMs on dsDNA translocation through an NP is highlighted using a set of NFMs of varying mesh composition that reduce the translocation speed relative to a bare pore from 1- to {\textgreater}100-fold. A representative NFM from this set is effective on DNA as long as 20 kbp, improves the nanopore resolution, and allows discrimination among different DNA lengths.},

The multilayers were grafted in a glove box having nitrogen ambient with both humidity and oxygen contents {\textless} 1 ppm using APTMS solutions prepared in an anhydrous toluene. Deposition of the multilayers has been carried out as a function of solution concentration and grafting time. Characterization of the multilayers using static de-ionized water contact angle, ellipsometry, X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscope measurements revealed that self-assembling of the multilayers takes place in two distinct stages: (i) the first APTMS monolayer chemisorbs on a hydroxylated oxide surface by a silanization process and, (ii) the surface amino group of the first monolayer chemisorbs the hydrolyzed silane group of other APTMS molecules present in the solution, leading to the formation of a bilayer. The second stage is a self-replicating process that results in the layer-by-layer self-assembly of the multilayers with trapped NH3+ ions. The current-voltage characteristics of the multilayers exhibit a hysteresis effect along with a negative differential resistance, suggesting their potential application in the molecular memory devices. A possible mechanism for the observed hysteresis effect based on filling and de-filling of the NH3+ acting as traps is presented.},

	abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) provide a selective passageway for receptor-mediated active transport between nucleus and cytoplasm, while maintaining the distinct molecular compositions of both compartments at large. In this review we discuss how NPCs gain a remarkable sorting selectivity from non-globular FG domains and their phase separation into dense polymer meshworks. The resulting sieve-like FG hydrogels are effective barriers to normal macromolecules but are at the same time highly permeable to shuttling nuclear transport receptors, which bind to FG motifs as well as to their designated cargoes. Phase separation driven by disordered protein domains was recently also recognized as being pivotal to the formation of membraneless organelles, making it an important emerging principle in cell biology. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are gigantic molecular machines that operate through the material properties of intrinsically disordered protein domains rich in FG domains. Cohesive FG domains spontaneously form dense hydrogel-like phases that reproduce the exquisite sorting ability of nuclear pores, privileging passage to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) and NTR-cargo complexes. Related intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are, for example, common to many nucleic acid-binding proteins, can also drive phase-separation and thereby form membraneless organelles such as P bodies or nucleoli. Taken together, multivalent low-affinity interactions between IDRs emerge as an important organizational strategy to form various different intracellular phases of specialized function, constitution, permselectivity, and spatiotemporal dynamics.},

For bare graphene, we encounter a paradox: whereas contaminated graphene nanopores facilitated DNA translocation well, clean crystalline graphene pores very quickly exhibit clogging of the pore. We attribute this to strong interactions between DNA nucleotides and graphene, yielding sticking and irreversible pore closure. We develop a general strategy to noncovalently tailor the hydrophobic surface of graphene by designing a dedicated self-assembled monolayer of pyrene ethylene glycol, which renders the surface hydrophilic.

Whether small molecules passively diffuse through a single central channel or through multiple holes of a hydrogel network is a subject of debate. Additionally, whether the passive and facilitated transport systems occupy distinct or overlapping physical regions of the NPC remains unclear. Here, we directly test these models using threedimensional super-resolution fluorescence microscopy of human cells. This approach reveals that a single viscous central channel in the NPC acts as the sole pathway for passive diffusion of various small molecules; transport receptors and their cargo complexes take distinct transport routes in the periphery, which is occluded by phenylalanine-glycine filaments. Furthermore, the passive and facilitated passageways in the NPC are closely correlated, and their conformations can be simultaneously regulated by Importin $\beta$1 (a major transport receptor) and RanGTP (a critical regulator of transport directionality). These results strongly favor a self-regulated viscous channel configuration in native NPCs over the porous hydrogel meshwork model.},

However, the fragility of these bilayers and current noise present serious problems in their application towards biosensor development. To address this problem, many experimental investigations employing micropores in the formation of lipid bilayers have been reported. In this work, we present a method for the fabrication of micropores using commercially available low-melting Teflon film and a heated tip. This method allowed for the rapid (in a few seconds) and reproducible fabrication of micropores 2-3 $\mu$m in diameter. We employed a single-channel recording using a gramicidin channel and confirmed that the bilayer membrane can form on micropores by the painting method. The bilayer formed is stable under high voltage (+1000 mV). Fabricated micropores possess a conical shape with sharp edges, features which facilitated the formation of artificial lipid bilayers which could be utilized for low-noise and high voltage recording due to decreased access resistance and increased bilayer stability. These advantages promise to improve the performance of artificial lipid bilayers when employed in the development of flexible biosensors. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nanopores and submicrometer pores have recently been explored for applications ranging from detection of single molecules, assemblies of nanoparticles, nucleic acids, occurrence of chemical reactions, and unfolding of proteins. Most of these applications rely on monitoring electrical current through these pores, hence the noise and signal bandwidth of these current recordings are critical for achieving accurate and sensitive measurements. In this report, we present a detailed theoretical and experimental study on the noise and signal bandwidth of current recordings from glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes that contain a single submicrometer pore or nanopore. We examined the theoretical signal bandwidth of two different pore geometries, and we measured the signal bandwidth of the electronics used to record the ionic current. We also investigated the theoretical noise generated by the substrate material, the pore, and the electronics used to record the current. Employing a combination of theory and experimental results, we were able to predict the noise in current traces recorded from glass and PET pores with no applied voltage with an error of less than 12{\%} in a range of signal bandwidths from 1 to 40 kHz. In approximately half of all experiments, application of a voltage did not significantly increase the noise. In the other half of experiments, however, application of a voltage resulted in an additional source of noise. For these pores, predictions of the noise were usually still accurate within 35{\%} error at signal bandwidths of at least 10 kHz. The power spectra of this extra noise suggested a 1/f(alpha) origin with best fits to the power spectrum for alpha = 0.4-0.8. This work provides the theoretical background and experimental data for understanding the bandwidth requirements and the main sources of noise in current recordings; it will be useful for minimizing noise and achieving accurate recordings.},

The FG Nup family has 11 members in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the study of mutants lacking different FG domains has been instrumental in testing transport models. To continue analyzing the distinct functional roles of FG Nups in vivo, additional robust genetic tools are required. Here, we describe a novel collection of S. cerevisiae mutant strains in which the FG domains of different groups of Nups are absent ($\Delta$) in the greatest number documented to date. Using this plasmid-based $\Delta$FG strategy, we find that a GLFG domain-only pore is sufficient for viability. The resulting extensive plasmid and strain resources are available to the scientific community for future in-depth in vivo studies of NPC transport.},

The density and the refractive index of the adsorbing protein layers could be determined from the complementary information provided by the two in situ instruments. The observed density and refractive index changes during the protein-adsorption process indicated the presence of conformational changes (e.g., partial unfolding) in general, especially upon contact with the hydrophobic surface. The structure of the formed layers was found to depend on the size of the proteins and on the experimental conditions. On the TiO2 surface smaller proteins formed a denser layer than larger ones and the layer of unfolded proteins was less dense than that adsorbed from the native conformation. The hydrophobic surface induced denaturation and resulted in the formation of thin compact protein films of albumin and lysozyme. A linear correlation was found between the quartz crystal microbalance measured dissipation factor and the total water content of the layer, suggesting the existence of a dissipative process that is related to the solvent molecules present inside the adsorbed protein layer. Our measurements indicated that water and solvent molecules not only influence the 3D structure of proteins in solution but also play a crucial role in their adsorption onto surfaces.},

	abstract = {Conformational changes at supramolecular interfaces are fundamentally coupled to binding activity, yet it remains a challenge to probe this relationship directly. Within the nuclear pore complex, this underlies how transport receptors known as karyopherins proceed through a tethered layer of intrinsically disordered nucleoporin domains containing Phe-Gly (FG)-rich repeats (FG domains) that otherwise hinder passive transport. Here, we use nonspecific proteins (i.e., BSA) as innate molecular probes to explore FG domain conformational changes by surface plasmon resonance. This mathematically diminishes the surface plasmon resonance refractive index constraint, thereby providing the means to acquire and correlate height changes in a surface-tethered FG domain layer to Kap binding affinities in situ with respect to their relative spatial arrangements. Stepwise measurements show that FG domain collapse is caused by karyopherin $\beta$1 (Kap$\beta$1) binding at low concentrations, but this gradually transitions into a reextension at higher Kap$\beta$1 concentrations. This ability to self-heal is intimately coupled to Kap$\beta$1-FG binding avidity that promotes the maximal incorporation of Kap$\beta$1 into the FG domain layer. Further increasing Kap$\beta$1 to physiological concentrations leads to a "pileup" of Kap$\beta$1 molecules that bind weakly to unoccupied FG repeats at the top of the layer. Therefore, binding avidity does not hinder fast transport per se. Revealing the biophysical basis underlying the form-function relationship of Kap$\beta$1-FG domain behavior results in a convergent picture in which transport and mechanistic aspects of nuclear pore complex functionality are reconciled.},

Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy was used to track the movement of cargos before, during, and after their interactions with NPCs. At low importin beta concentrations, about half of the signal-dependent cargos that interacted with an NPC were translocated across the NE, indicating a nuclear import efficiency of approximately 50{\%}. At high importin beta concentrations, the import efficiency increased to approximately 80{\%} and the transit speed increased approximately sevenfold. The transit speed and import efficiency of a signal-independent cargo was also increased by high importin beta concentrations. These results demonstrate that maximum nucleocytoplasmic transport velocities can be modulated by at least approximately 10-fold by the importin beta concentration and therefore suggest a potential mechanism for regulating the speed of cargo traffic across the NE.},

However, standard frequentist methods of pooling are known to underestimate statistical uncertainty in the true risk distribution when the number of studies pooled is small. Alternatively, Bayesian pooling methods using noninformative priors yield unrealistically large amounts of uncertainty in this case. We present a new hybrid frequentist-bayesian framework for meta-analysis that incorporates features of both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, yielding estimated uncertainty distributions that are more useful for burden estimation. We also present an example of mortality risk due to long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter obtained from a small number of cohort studies conducted in the United States and Europe. We compare our new risk uncertainty distribution to that obtained by the integrated exposure-response (IER) model used in the Global Burden of Disease 2010 project for which risk was modeled over the entire global concentration range. We suggest a method to incorporate our new risk uncertainty distribution based on the relatively low concentrations observed in the United States and western Europe into the IER model, thus extending risk estimation to the global concentration range.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the number of scientific reports in which the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique has played a key role in elucidating various aspects of biological materials and their interactions. This article illustrates some key advances in the development of a special variation of this technique called quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The main feature and advantage of QCM-D, compared with the conventional QCM, is that it in addition to measuring changes in resonant frequency (Deltaf), a simultaneous parameter related to the energy loss or dissipation (DeltaD) of the system is also measured. Deltaf essentially measures changes in the mass attached to the sensor surface, while DeltaD measures properties related to the viscoelastic properties of the adlayer. Thus, QCM-D measures two totally independent properties of the adlayer. The focus of this review is an overview of the QCM-D technology and highlights of recent applications. Specifically, recent applications dealing with DNA, proteins, lipids, and cells will be detailed. This is not intended as a comprehensive review of all possible applications of the QCM-D technology, but rather a glimpse into a few highlighted application areas in the biomolecular field that were published in 2007.},

The adsorption process and the structure of the hydrated adsorbed layers are followed by quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and atomic force microscopy. The unhydrated surfaces are characterized by ellipsometry and contact angle techniques. The adsorption kinetics and the extent of adsorption are determined by monitoring the changes in resonance frequency and refractive index of sensors coated with ultrathin films of the various substrates. Langmuirian-type adsorption kinetics is observed in all cases studied. The amount of adsorbed Pluronic on hydrophobic polymer surfaces (PP, PET, and nylon) exceeds that on the hydrophilic cellulose. The hydrophobic (graphite) mineral surface adsorbs relatively low polymer mass, typical of a monolayer, while micellar structures are observed on the hydrophilic silica surface. The amount of water coupled to the adsorbed polymer layers is quantified by combining data from QCM, and SPR are found to increase with increasing polarity of the substrate. On the basis of contact angle data, the nonhydrated adsorbed structures produce modest increases in hydrophilicity of all the substrates investigated.

A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by 'top-down' methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide 'staple strands' to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).},

	abstract = {We report experimental measurements of the salt dependence of ion transport and DNA translocation through solid-state nanopores. The ionic conductance shows a three-order-of-magnitude decrease with decreasing salt concentrations from 1 M to 1 $\mu$M, strongly deviating from bulk linear behavior. The data are described by a model that accounts for a salt-dependent surface charge of the pore. Subsequently, we measure translocation of 16.5-$\mu$m-long dsDNA for 50 mM to 1 M salt concentrations. DNA translocation is shown to result in either a decrease ([KCl] {\textgreater} 0.4 M) or increase of the ionic current ([KCl] {\textless} 0.4 M). The data are described by a model where current decreases result from the partial blocking of the pore and current increases are attributed to motion of the counterions that screen the charge of the DNA backbone. We demonstrate that the two competing effects cancel at a KCl concentration of 370 ± 40 mM.},

	abstract = {Measurements on protein translocation through solid-state nanopores reveal anomalous (non-Smoluchowski) transport behavior, as evidenced by extremely low detected event rates; that is, the capture rates are orders of magnitude smaller than what is theoretically expected. Systematic experimental measurements of the event rate dependence on the diffusion constant are performed by translocating proteins ranging in size from 6 to 660 kDa. The discrepancy is observed to be significantly larger for smaller proteins, which move faster and have a lower signal-to-noise ratio. This is further confirmed by measuring the event rate dependence on the pore size and concentration for a large 540 kDa protein and a small 37 kDa protein, where only the large protein follows the expected behavior. We dismiss various possible causes for this phenomenon and conclude that it is due to a combination of the limited temporal resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio. A one-dimensional first-passage time-distribution model supports this and suggests that the bulk of the proteins translocate on time scales faster than can be detected. We discuss the implications for protein characterization using solid-state nanopores and highlight several possible routes to address this problem.},

For a circular hole in a membrane of zero thickness, an analytical result is possible up to quadrature. For a membrane of arbitrary thickness, the full Poisson--Nernst--Planck--Stokes system of equations is solved numerically using a finite volume method. The numerical solution agrees with the standard analytical result for electro-osmotic flux through a long cylindrical pore when the membrane thickness is large compared to the hole diameter. When the membrane thickness is small, the flow rate agrees with that calculated using the reciprocal theorem.},

Although nanopores can be classified into two categories, solid-state and biological, they are essentially two sides of the same coin. For instance, both garner popularity due to their ability to confine analytes of interest to a nanoscale volume. Due to the vast diversity of nanopore platforms and applications, no single review can cover the entire landscape of published work in the field. Therefore, in this article focus will be placed on recent advancements and developments taking place in the field of solid-state nanopores. It should be stated that the intention of this tutorial review is not to cite all articles relating to solid-state nanopores, but rather to highlight recent, select developments that will hopefully benefit the new and seasoned scientist alike. Initially we begin with the fundamentals of solid-state nanopore sensing. Then the spotlight is shone on the sophisticated fabrication methods that have their origins in the semiconductor industry. One inherent advantage of solid-state nanopores is in the ease of functionalizing the surface with a range of molecules carrying functional groups. Therefore, an entire section is devoted to highlighting various chemical and bio-molecular modifications and explores how these permit the development of novel sensors with specific targets and functions. The review is completed with a discussion on novel detection strategies using nanopores. Although the most popular mode of nanopore sensing is based upon what has come to be known as ionic-current blockade sensing, there is a vast, growing literature based around exploring alternative detection techniques to further expand on the versatility of the sensors. Such techniques include optical, electronic, and force based methods. It is perhaps fair to say that these new frontiers have caused further excitement within the sensing community.},

Admittedly, the chapter will emphasize solid-state nanopore devices over their organic counterparts, though due to their strong overlap much of the material presented is directly applicable to the case of biological nanopores. We review the operating principle of low-noise current amplifiers used to apply voltages across a membrane and measure the resulting ionic current. Knowledge of the electronic circuitry allows us to identify the contributing sources of noise, including those associated with the nanopore device, the measurement electronics, and those arising from their integration. We examine noise generated by the digitizer, the use of electronic filters to suppress high-frequency noise, and discuss sampling considerations to maximize temporal resolution and SNR.

	abstract = {Staphylococcal $\alpha$-hemolysin ($\alpha$-HL) is a $\beta$-barrel pore-forming toxin (PFT) expressed by Staphylococcus aureus. $\alpha$-HL is secreted as a water-soluble monomeric protein, which binds to target membranes and forms membrane-inserted heptameric pores. To explore the pore-forming mechanism of $\alpha$-HL in detail, we determined the crystal structure of the $\alpha$-HL monomer and prepore using H35A mutant and W179A/R200A mutant, respectively. Although the overall structure of the monomer was similar to that of other staphylococcal PFTs, a marked difference was observed in the N-terminal amino latch, which bent toward the prestem. Moreover, the prestem was fastened by the cap domain with a key hydrogen bond between Asp45 and Tyr118. Prepore structure showed that the transmembrane region is roughly formed with flexibility, although the upper half of the $\beta$-barrel is formed appropriately. Structure comparison among monomer, prepore and pore revealed a series of motions, in which the N-terminal amino latch released upon oligomerization destroys its own key hydrogen bond between Asp45-Tyr118. This action initiated the protrusion of the prestem. Y118F mutant and the N-terminal truncated mutant markedly decreased in the hemolytic activity, indicating the importance of the key hydrogen bond and the N-terminal amino latch on the pore formation. Based on these observations, we proposed a dynamic molecular mechanism of pore formation for $\alpha$-HL.},

It is also thought to play a key role in cell signaling processes associated with functional plasma membrane microdomains (domains enriched in cholesterol), commonly referred to as rafts. In all of these diverse biological phenomena, the transverse location of cholesterol in the membrane is almost certainly an important structural feature. Using a combination of neutron scattering and solid-state2H NMR, we have determined the location and orientation of cholesterol in phosphatidylcholine (PC) model membranes having fatty acids of different lengths and degrees of unsaturation. The data establish that cholesterol reorients rapidly about the bilayer normal in all the membranes studied, but is tilted and forced to span the bilayer midplane in the very thin bilayers.

Solid state nanopore sensors are especially promising for this type of single-molecule sensing because of the ability to analyze patterns in the ionic current signatures of DNA molecules. Here, we systematically demonstrate the use of highly specific dCas9 probes to create unique barcodes on the DNA that can be read out using nanopore sensors. Single dCas9 probes are targeted to various positions on DNA strands up to 48 kbp long and are effectively measured in high salt conditions typical of nanopore sensing. Multiple probes bound to the same DNA strand at characteristic target sequences create distinct barcodes of double and triple peaks. Finally, double and triple barcodes are used to simultaneously identify two different DNA targets in a background mixture of bacterial DNA. Our method forms the basis of a fast and versatile assay for multiplexed DNA sensing applications in complex samples.},

Using fluorescence microscopy, we measured in vivo the permeability of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NPC for multidomain proteins of different sizes and found that soluble proteins of 150 kDa and membrane proteins with an extralumenal domain of 90 kDa were still partly localized in the nucleus on a time scale of hours. The NPCs thus form only a weak barrier for the majority of yeast proteins, given their monomeric size. Using FG$\Delta$-mutant strains, we showed that specific combinations of Nups, especially with Nup100, but not the total mass of FG-nups per pore, were important for forming the barrier. Models of the disordered phase of wild-type and mutant NPCs were generated using a one bead per amino acid molecular dynamics model. The permeability measurements correlated with the density predictions from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in the center of the NPC. The combined in vivo and computational approach provides a framework for elucidating the structural and functional properties of the permeability barrier of nuclear pore complexes.},

These limitations of biological nanopores have been addressed by the use of solid-state nanopores which are artificially drilled holes in silicon nitride (or silicon oxide, or graphene) membranes. The solid state technology makes it possible to fabricate robust nanopores with variable pore dimensions (discussed in Chapter 6) which can be used over a much wider range of experimental conditions. These solid state pores have perfectly complemented the biological nanopores for single molecule detection and analysis by expanding the experimental repertoire; and by incorporating new electrical and/or optical detection strategies. This chapter will focus on various applications for which solid state nanopores have been used. We will start with DNA and RNA translocations and then move to DNA unzipping, optical detection, DNA sequencing and finally end with protein analysis using the solid state nanopores. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To decelerate the translocation speed, here, we employed a common protein cross-link interaction to achieve a general and robust nanopore sensing platform for single-molecule detection of protein. Benefiting from the EDC/NHS coupling interaction between nanopore and proteins, a 10-fold decrease in speed has been achieved. The clearly distinguishable current signatures further reveal that the anisotropic translocation of a protein, which are horizontal, vertical, and flipping transit inside nanopore confinement.

	abstract = {Nanopores and submicrometer pores have recently been explored for applications ranging from detection of single molecules, assemblies of nanoparticles, nucleic acids, occurrence of chemical reactions, and unfolding of proteins. Most of these applications rely on monitoring electrical current through these pores, hence the noise and signal bandwidth of these current recordings are critical for achieving accurate and sensitive measurements. In this report, we present a detailed theoretical and experimental study on the noise and signal bandwidth of current recordings from glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes that contain a single submicrometer pore or nanopore. We examined the theoretical signal bandwidth of two different pore geometries, and we measured the signal bandwidth of the electronics used to record the ionic current. We also investigated the theoretical noise generated by the substrate material, the pore, and the electronics used to record the current. Employing a combination of theory and experimental results, we were able to predict the noise in current traces recorded from glass and PET pores with no applied voltage with an error of less than 12{\%} in a range of signal bandwidths from 1 to 40 kHz. In approximately half of all experiments, application of a voltage did not significantly increase the noise. In the other half of experiments, however, application of a voltage resulted in an additional source of noise. For these pores, predictions of the noise were usually still accurate within 35{\%} error at signal bandwidths of at least 10 kHz. The power spectra of this extra noise suggested a 1/f(alpha) origin with best fits to the power spectrum for alpha = 0.4-0.8. This work provides the theoretical background and experimental data for understanding the bandwidth requirements and the main sources of noise in current recordings; it will be useful for minimizing noise and achieving accurate recordings.},

Although the critical information obtained from nanopores (for example, DNA sequence) comes from the signal collected during DNA translocation, the throughput of the method is determined by the rate at which molecules arrive and thread into the pores. Here, we study the process of DNA capture into nanofabricated SiN pores of molecular dimensions. For fixed analyte concentrations we find an increase in capture rate as the DNA length increases from 800 to 8,000 base pairs, a length-independent capture rate for longer molecules, and increasing capture rates when ionic gradients are established across the pore. Furthermore, we show that application of a 20-fold salt gradient allows the detection of picomolar DNA concentrations at high throughput. The salt gradients enhance the electric field, focusing more molecules into the pore, thereby advancing the possibility of analysing unamplified DNA samples using nanopores.},

However, it is difficult to accurately monitor the polymerization rate, which limits the use of polymer brushes in applications where control of thickness is desirable. We present a new methodology based on angular surface plasmon resonance (SPR) which provides real-time measurements of the thickness evolution during atom transfer radical polymerization, using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) as an example. Our data analysis shows that the growth is linear with a rate of ∼20 nm/min in a water/methanol mixture up to ∼100 nm after which chain termination gradually reduces the growth rate. Further, we introduce an improved method in SPR which makes it possible to determine changes in brush height and refractive index during switching of responsive polymers. The ratio between heights in the coil to globule transition at 32 °C in water was found to be almost 5, independent of the initial absolute height up to ∼200 nm, in agreement with theory. Complementary quartz crystal microbalance and atomic force microscopy data confirm the accuracy of our results. With the methodology presented here the established SPR technique can be used for quantitative characterization of surface-initiated polymerization and responsive polymer brushes.},

To address these limitations, high-sensitivity optical detection techniques that complement the electrical measurements have been developed. The optical techniques involve high-bandwidth, multicolor and high-throughput measurements. Here we review the recent advancements and developments that have been taking place in the field of optical sensing in solid-state nanopores. We describe the main optical methods used in this field involving total internal reflection and confocal microscopy in addition to sophisticated background suppression strategies.

	abstract = {It is well-known that solutes in liquid-filled pores of molecular dimensions have reduced diffusivities and are sieved during filtration. For solute molecules that are large enough to act as hydrodynamic particles, these phenomena can be explained by a combination of particle-wall hydrodynamic interactions and steric restrictions. Theoretical expressions that include those effects have been available for many years, but, even for spheres in pores of constant cross-section, certain hydrodynamic information has been lacking until recently. In particular, the local enhanced drag and local lag coefficient for off-axis positions had not been fully characterized, requiring that results for symmetrically positioned particles ("centerline approximations") be employed in predicting diffusional and convective hindrances. In this paper the current status of hindered transport theory is reviewed for neutral spheres in long cylindrical pores or slits, and it is shown that such approximations are no longer necessary. New expressions are presented for diffusive and convective hindrance factors that are properly averaged over the pore cross-section. The root-mean-square errors in the centerline approximations are 20{\%} and 6{\%}, respectively, for diffusive and convective hindrance factors in cylindrical pores; for slit pores the corresponding errors are 16{\%} and 10{\%}. Comparisons are made between the predictions and recent data obtained by tracking particle positions in microchannels. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

Here, the relationship is unveiled by characterizing the interfacial process with impedance spectroscopy assisted by a dedicated electrochemical impedance model. The model incorporates both thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the amphoteric hydrogen ion site-binding reactions with the surface OH groups. It further takes into consideration the distributed nature of the characteristic energy of the binding sites. The simulated impedance matches the experimental data better with an energy distribution of the kinetic parameters than with that of the thermodynamic ones. Since the potentiometric low-frequency noise (LFN) originating from the solid/liquid interface correlates excellently with the real part of its electrochemical impedance spectrum, this work establishes a method for evaluating sensing surface quality aimed at mitigating LFN.},

The current noise through the open channels had a rather small spectral density, which was a function of the inverse frequency up to about 100 Hz. The spectral density of the noise of the open LamB channels was a quadratic function of the applied voltage. Its magnitude was not correlated to the number of channels in the lipid bilayer membrane. Upon addition of sugars to the aqueous phase the current decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, the spectral density of the current noise increased drastically, which indicated interaction of the sugars with the binding site inside the channel. The frequency dependence of the spectral density was of Lorentzian type, although the power of its frequency dependence was not identical to -2. Analysis of the power density spectra using a previously proposed simple model (Benz, R., A. Schmid, and G. H. Vos-Scheperkeuter. 1987. J. Membr. Biol. 100: 12–29), allowed the evaluation of the on- and the off-rate constants for the maltopentaose binding to the binding site inside the LamB channels. This means also that the maltopentaose flux through the LamB channel could be estimated by assuming a simple one-site, two-barrier model for the sugar transport from the results of the noise analysis. {\textcopyright} 1994, The Biophysical Society.

The ion mobilities show the same trends as the experimental results with distinct maxima for cations and anions. The mobilities (defined by ui = Di/kT) of the corresponding uncharged species are also determined by simulation and are in qualitative agreement with Stokes' law. The mobilities of Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and F- increase on discharge, whereas Cl, Br, and I have smaller mobilities than the corresponding anions. The mobility of the fictitious I+ ion, which differs from I- only in its charge, lies between that of I- and I in the order uI {\textless} uI+ {\textless} uI?. The residence time of water in the first solvation shell of small cations (Li+ and Na+) and Ca2+ decreases when the ions are discharged, while the opposite is observed on neutralizing I-, suggesting the formation of a solvent cage around the large uncharged I which partially breaks up on charging, increasing the mobility of the corresponding ion. The cage breakup is greater for I- than for I+ which correlates with the asymmetry in the entropies of solvation of I- and I+, in SPC/E water on charge reversal, providing an explanation for the trends in the mobilities of I, I-, and I+. The residence times of water in the primary hydration shell around cations pass through a minimum as a function of size that correlates with the maximum in the corresponding solvation entropy, suggesting different types of hydration, i.e., electrostatic ion solvation (hydrophilic) and cage formation (hydrophobic) respectively for small and large cations. The results are in accord with recent calculations of the solvation entropy and free energy as continuous functions of the charge and size (Lynden-Bell, R. M.; Rasaiah, J. C. J. Chem. Phys. 1997, 107, 1981). Hydrophilic and hydrophobic solvation are reflected in the exchange dynamics of the water in the hydration shells around charged and uncharged solutes. The solvation dynamics of individual cations and anions are distinct at short times but characterized by the solvent at long times. Solvent dynamics, structure, and caging modulated by the charge and size of the ions are strongly implicated in determining their mobilities.},

The residence time can be extended to several milliseconds by the manipulation of pH and transmembrane potential. Here, we describe mutant homoheptameric alphaHL pores that are capable of accommodating betaCD for tens of seconds. The mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis at position 113, which is a residue that lies near a constriction in the lumen of the transmembrane beta barrel, and fall into two classes. Members of the tight-binding class, M113D, M113N, M113V, M113H, M113F and M113Y, bind betaCD approximately 10(4)-fold more avidly than the remaining alphaHL pores, including WT-alphaHL. The lower K(d) values of these mutants are dominated by reduced values of k(off). The major effect of the mutations is most likely a remodeling of the binding site for betaCD in the vicinity of position 113. In addition, there is a smaller voltage-sensitive component of the binding, which is also affected by the residue at 113 and may result from transport of the neutral betaCD molecule by electroosmotic flow. The mutant pores for which the dwell time of betaCD is prolonged can serve as improved components for stochastic sensors.},

As such, this review begins with a brief history of our work developing the nanopore MspA for nanopore sequencing. We then describe the underlying principles of SPRNT, how it works in detail, and propose some potential future uses.

The dependence of membrane specific capacitance on the chain-length of the alkane oil present in the bilayer is similar to that observed in black lipid membranes. In contrast to conventional artificial bilayers, DIBs are not confined by an aperture, which enables us to determine that the dependence of whole bilayer capacitance on applied potential is predominantly a result of a spontaneous increase in bilayer area. This area change arises from the creation of new bilayer at the three phase interface and is driven by changes in surface tension with applied potential that can be described by the Young-Lippmann equation. By accounting for this area change, we are able to determine the proportion of the capacitance dependence that arises from a change in specific capacitance with applied potential. This method provides a new tool with which to investigate the vertical compression of the bilayer and understand the changes in bilayer thickness with applied potential. We find that, for 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine membranes in hexadecane, specific bilayer capacitance varies by 0.6-1.5{\%} over an applied potential of ±100 mV.},

More specifically, we characterize monolayers of natively unfolded nucleoporin domains that are rich in phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FGRDs). An FGRD meshwork is thought to be responsible for the selectivity of macromolecular transport across the nuclear pore complex between the cytosol and the nucleus of living cells. We demonstrate that nucleoporin FGRD films can be formed on His-tag Capturing Sensors with properties comparable to a previously reported immobilization platform based on supported lipid bilayers (SLB). Approaches to extract the film thickness and viscoelastic properties in a time-resolved manner from the QCM-D response are described, with particular emphasis on the practical implementation of viscoelastic modeling and a detailed analysis of the quality and reliability of the fit. By comparing the results with theoretical predictions for the viscoelastic properties of polymer solutions and gels, and experimental data from an atomic force microscopy indentation assay, we demonstrate that detailed analysis can provide novel insight into the morphology and dynamics of FG repeat domain films.

We generated 91.2 Gb of sequence data ({\~{}}30x theoretical coverage) from 39 flowcells. De novo assembly yielded a highly complete and contiguous assembly (NG50 {\~{}}3Mb). We observed considerable variability in homopolymeric tract resolution between different basecallers.

	abstract = {Optical nanoantennas have a great potential for enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanometer scale, yet fabrication accuracy and lack of scalability currently limit ultimate antenna performance and applications. In most designs, the region of maximum field localization and enhancement (i.e., hotspot) is not readily accessible to the sample because it is buried into the nanostructure. Moreover, current large-scale fabrication techniques lack reproducible geometrical control below 20 nm. Here, we describe a new nanofabrication technique that applies planarization, etch back, and template stripping to expose the excitation hotspot at the surface, providing a major improvement over conventional electron beam lithography methods. We present large flat surface arrays of in-plane nanoantennas, featuring gaps as small as 10 nm with sharp edges, excellent reproducibility and full surface accessibility of the hotspot confined region. The novel fabrication approach drastically improves the optical performance of plasmonic nanoantennas to yield giant fluorescence enhancement factors up to 10 4 −10 5 times, together with nanoscale detection volumes in the 20 zL range. The method is fully scalable and adaptable to a wide range of antenna designs. We foresee broad applications by the use of these in-plane antenna geometries ranging from large-scale ultrasensitive sensor chips to microfluidics and live cell membrane investigations. O ptical nanoantennas take advantage of the plasmonic response of noble metals to strongly confine light energy into nanoscale dimensions and breach the classical diffraction limit. 1−3 This confinement leads to a drastic enhancement of the interactions between a single quantum emitter and the light field, 4−7 enabling large fluorescence gains above a thousand fold, 8−13 ultrafast picosecond emission, 14−16 and photobleach-ing reduction. 17,18 As such, optical antennas hold great interest for ultrasensitive biosensing, especially for the detection of single molecules at biologically relevant micromolar concentrations. 19−21 Biosensing applications of nanoantennas require the large-scale availability of narrow accessible gaps. Not only should nanogaps with sub-20 nm dimensions be reproducibly fabricated but also the gap region (plasmonic hotspot) must remain accessible to probe the target molecules. Despite impressive recent progress using electron beam, 22 focused ion beam, 23 or stencil lithographies 24−26 or alternatively with bottom-up self-assembly techniques, 6,7,9,13,16,27−30 the challenges of reliable narrow gap fabrication and hotspot accessibility remain major hurdles limiting the impact and performance of optical nanoantennas. For instance, when aiming for the fabrication of aperture antennas, electron beam lithography (EBL) using a positive-tone resist requires metal dry etching, which produces high line-edge roughness that are not suited for the definition of reliable and high aspect ratio nanogaps. Alternatively, patterning openings in metal films relying on EBL and negative-tone resist demands a lift-off approach. This is an efficient approach when lifting a full metal film for fabricating single particles but can be arduous when removing small isolated clusters of metal to clear apertures. Here, we report on a novel nanofabrication technique based on EBL followed by planarization, etch back, and template stripping. The process provides large flat arrays of in-plane nanoantennas featuring 10 nm gaps with sharp edges and full accessibility of the localized hotspot illumination provided by},

	abstract = {The preprotein translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (Tom) is a multisubunit machinery containing receptors and a general import pore (GIP). We have analyzed the molecular architecture of the Tom machinery. The receptor Tom22 stably associates with Tom40, the main component of the GIP, in a complex with a molecular weight of ∼400,000 (∼400K), while the other receptors, Tom20 and Tom70, are more loosely associated with this GIP complex and can be found in distinct subcomplexes. A yeast mutant lacking both Tom20 and Tom70 can still form the GIP complex when sufficient amounts of Tom22 are synthesized. Besides the essential proteins Tom22 and Tom40, the GIP complex contains three small subunits, Tom5, Tom6, and Tom7. In mutant mitochondria lacking Tom6, the interaction between Tom22 and Tom40 is destabilized, leading to the dissociation of Tom22 and the generation of a subcomplex of ∼100K containing Tom40, Tom7, and Tom5. Tom6 is required to promote but not to maintain a stable association between Tom22 and Tom40. The following conclusions are suggested. (i) The GIP complex, containing Tom40, Tom22, and three small Tom proteins, forms the central unit of the outer membrane import machinery. (ii) Tom20 and Tom70 are not essential for the generation of the GIP complex. (iii) Tom6 functions as an assembly factor for Tom22, promoting its stable association with Tom40.},

Here we present Monte Carlo and Density Functional Theory approaches to identify different collective phases of end-grafted polymers in a nanopore and to study their relative stability as a function of intermolecular interactions. Over a range of system parameters that is relevant for nuclear pore complexes, we observe two distinct phases: one with the bulk of the polymers condensed at the wall of the pore, and the other with the polymers condensed along its central axis. The relative stability of these two phases depends on the interpolymer interactions. The existence the two phases suggests a transport mechanism in which marginal changes in these interactions, possibly induced by nuclear transport receptors, cause the pore to transform between open and closed configurations.},

In this paper, three categories of forces proposed in the literature to oppose the electrical driving forces in the DNA translocation process are analyzed, (1) the entropic forces of DNA uncoiling/recoiling at the pore entrance/exits, (2) the viscous drag acting on the blob like DNA outside the nanopore, and (3) the viscous drag acting on the linear DNA inside the nanopore. The magnitudes of these forces are calculated based on the parameters used in experiments and it is shown that the first two of the aforementioned categories of forces are usually small compared to the electrical driving force, while the last one is of the same order as the electrical driving force. To evaluate the viscous drag force acting on the linear DNA inside the nanopore, a hydrodynamic model based on the lubrication approximation is used to calculate the flow field and the viscous drag force acting on a DNA immobilized in a nanopore. This model is validated by good agreement with the experimental data for the tethering force used to immobilize a DNA inside the nanopore.},

First we establish a theoretical platform, which allows quantitative analysis of the combined SPR and QCM-D data. With this theoretical base, new information can be extracted, not obtainable with either technique alone. As an example we demonstrate how time-resolved measurements with these two techniques in combination-yielding three independent measured quantities-add new information about (i) kinetics, i.e. number of adsorbed molecules per unit area versus time, and (ii) temporal variation in the mass fraction of coupled water versus coverage. In particular, it is demonstrated for the first time, how the kinetics of the process during which adsorbed vesicles are spontaneously transformed into a supported phospholipid bilayer (SPB) on SiO2 can be quantitatively separated into its two dominating states: adsorbed vesicles and supported planar bilayer patches. In addition, the relevance of dynamically coupled water for interpretation and modeling of the QCM-D response during bilayer formation is discussed and further illustrated with a second model system: streptavidin adsorption on a biotin-modified SPB. A very strong coverage dependence in the number of water molecules per protein sensed by the QCM is demonstrated, with strong implications for the use of QCM as a tool for quantitative determination of protein mass uptake kinetics.},

On the basis of these electrical characteristics it is expected that patch pipettes pulled from quartz tubing will produce significantly less noise than pipettes made from other glasses. Our work confirms these expectations and we describe theoretical and practical aspects of the use of quartz pipettes for single channel patch voltage clamp measurements. Methods for pulling quartz pipettes with a laser-based puller and coating them with low-loss elastomers are discussed, as are precautions that are necessary to achieve low noise recordings. We have shown that quartz pipettes can be pulled from tubing with outer diameter to inner diameter ratios as large as 3 and a method of applying heavy elastomer coatings all the way to the tip of pipettes is presented. Noise sources arising from the pipette and its holder are described theoretically, and it is shown that measured noise is in good agreement with such predictions. With low noise capacitive feedback electronics, small geometry holders, and thick-walled quartz pipettes coated with low-loss elastomers we have been routinely able to achieve noise of 100 fA rms or less in a 5-kHz bandwidth with real cell patches and a pipette immersion depth of approximately 2 mm. On occasion we have achieved noise as low as 60 fA rms in this bandwidth. {\textcopyright} 1993, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

Both the dielectric and flicker noise of the device, which have been described as one of the bottlenecks to making highly sensitive 2-D membrane nanopore devices, have been reduced as follows. Firstly, a pyrex substrate with a low dielectric constant ($\epsilon$r = 4.7–5.1) and low dielectric loss (D {\textless} 0.001) is used instead of a Si substrate to reduce the dielectric noise of the device. Secondly, flicker noise is minimized by employing a 100 nm thick SiNx supporting layer with a small opening (less than 100 nm) for BN membrane transfer to enhance the mechanical stability. The flicker noise is further reduced by transferring multiple layers of BN instead of a single layer of BN. The resulting multi-layered BN device shows significant reduction of dielectric and 1/f noise as compared to the devices with a single layer of the BN and Si substrate.

In particular, molecular recognition force microscopy has proven to be a powerful tool for the investigation of biological interactions under near physiological conditions. For this purpose, ligands are tethered to AFM tips and the interaction forces with cognate receptors on the sample surface are measured with pico-Newton accuracy. In the first step of tip functionalization, amino groups are typically introduced on the initially inert AFM tip. Several methods have been developed to reproducibly adjust the desired low density of amino groups on the tip surface, i.e. esterification with ethanolamine, gas-phase silanization with aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES), or treatment with aminophenyl-trimethoxysilane (APhS) in toluene solution. In the present study, the usefulness of these methods for attachments of antibodies to AFM tips was characterized by a standardized test system, in which biotinylated IgG was bound to the tip and a dense monolayer of avidin on mica served as test sample. All three methods of aminofunctionalization were found fully satisfactory for attachment of single antibodies to AFM tips, only in a parallel macroscopic assay on silicon nitride chips a minor difference was found in that APTES appeared to yield a slightly lower surface density of amino groups. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Eukaryotic chromosomes are confined to the nucleus, which is separated from the rest of the cell by two concentric membranes known as the nuclear envelope (NE). The NE is punctuated by holes known as nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which provide the main pathway for transport of cellular material across the nuclear-cytoplasmic boundary. The single NPC is a complicated octameric structure containing more than 100 proteins called nucleoporins. NPCs function as transport machineries for inorganic ions and macromolecules. The most prominent feature of an individual NPC is a large central channel, {\~{}}7 nm in width and 50 nm in length. NPCs exhibit high morphological and functional plasticity, adjusting shape to function. Macromolecules ranging from 1 to {\textgreater}100 kDa travel through the central channel into (and out of) the nucleoplasm. Inorganic ions have additional pathways for communication between cytosol and nucleus. NE can turn from a simple sieve that separates two compartments by a given pore size to a smart barrier that adjusts its permeabiltiy to the metabolic demands of the cell. Early microelectrode work characterizes the NE as a membrane barrier of highly variable permeability, indicating that NPCs are under regulatory control. Electrical voltage across the NE is explained as the result of electrical charge separation due to selective barrier permeability and unequal distribution of charged macromolecules across the NE. Patch-clamp work discovers NE ion channel activity associated with NPC function. From comparison of early microelectrode work with patch-clamp data and late results obtained by the nuclear hourglass technique, it is concluded that NPCs are well-controlled supramolecular structures that mediate transport of macromolecules and small ions by separate physical pathways, the large central channel and the small peripheral channels, respectively. Electrical properties of the two pathways are still unclear but could have great impact on the understanding of signal transfer across NE and gene expression.},

On the generator side, the diode rectifier is employed for cost reduction. Assuming the grid-side converter is a pulse-width modulated (PWM) current source inverter (CSI), analyses on feasibility of using the diode rectifier and its impact on system control, operating range and rating design are presented. It is then revealed that under limited device switching frequency, using a multilevel configuration to replace the single PWM-CSI on the grid side effectively increases the equivalent inverter frequency, lowers the requirement on filter capacitance, extends the whole operating range and therefore brings benefits to many aspects of the system. For operation of the multilevel CSI, a five level space vector modulation scheme offering superior harmonic profile and minimum switching frequency is designed. The dc current balancing between paralleled inverter bridges is realized by proper selection of redundant switching states. Simulation results obtained from a 2MW Matlab/Simulink model are provided to verify the proposed concepts. View full abstract»},

Here, we present a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) nanopore (CNP) amplifier capable of low noise recordings at an unprecedented 10 MHz bandwidth. When integrated with state-of-the-art solid-state nanopores in silicon nitride membranes, we achieve an SNR of greater than 10 for ssDNA translocations at a measurement bandwidth of 5 MHz, which represents the fastest ion current recordings through nanopores reported to date. We observe transient features in ssDNA translocation events that are as short as 200 ns, which are hidden even at bandwidths as high as 1 MHz. These features offer further insights into the translocation kinetics of molecules entering and exiting the pore. This platform highlights the advantages of high-bandwidth translocation measurements made possible by integrating nanopores and custom-designed electronics.},

The protein charge and diffusion coefficient, inferred with the Einstein law, can be orders of magnitude smaller than their bare values depending on the electrolyte concentration, pore diameter, chemical nature of the pore wall, and the externally applied voltage. The main contributors to the discrepancies are the coupled dynamics of the protein and its counterion cloud, confinement effects inside the pore, and the protein-pore-surface interaction. We have addressed these ingredients by harking on classical theories of electrophoresis of macroions and hydrodynamics inside pores, and deriving new results for pore-protein interactions. Putting together various components, we present approximate analytical formulas for the effective charge, diffusion coefficient, and mobility of a protein in the context of single molecule electrophoresis experiments. For the omnipresent pore-protein interactions, nonlinear dependence of the velocity of protein on voltage sets in readily and analytical formulas for this effect are presented. The derived formulas enable the determination of the bare charge and size of a protein from the experimentally measured apparent values. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {Nucleocytoplasmic transport is sustained by karyopherins (Kaps) and a Ran guanosine triphosphate (RanGTP) gradient that imports nuclear localization signal (NLS)–specific cargoes (NLS-cargoes) into the nucleus. However, how nuclear pore complex (NPC) barrier selectivity, Kap traffic, and NLS-cargo release are systematically linked and simultaneously regulated remains incoherent. In this study, we show that Kap$\alpha$ facilitates Kap$\beta$1 turnover and occupancy at the NPC in a RanGTP-dependent manner that is directly coupled to NLS-cargo release and NPC barrier function. This is underpinned by the binding affinity of Kap$\beta$1 to phenylalanine–glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups), which is comparable with RanGTP{\textperiodcentered}Kap$\beta$1, but stronger for Kap$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}Kap$\beta$1. On this basis, RanGTP is ineffective at releasing standalone Kap$\beta$1 from NPCs. Depleting Kap$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}Kap$\beta$1 by RanGTP further abrogates NPC barrier function, whereas adding back Kap$\beta$1 rescues it while Kap$\beta$1 turnover softens it. Therefore, the FG Nups are necessary but insufficient for NPC barrier function. We conclude that Kaps constitute integral constituents of the NPC whose barrier, transport, and cargo release functionalities establish a continuum under a mechanism of Kap-centric control.},

However, high noise level hampers applications of graphene nanopore sensors, especially at low frequencies. In this article, we report on a study of the contribution of suspended graphene area to noise level in full frequency band. Monolayer graphene films are transferred onto SiNx substrates preset with holes in varied diameters and formed self-supported films. After that, the films are perforated with smaller, nanoscale holes. Experimental studies indicate a dependency of low-frequency 1/f noise on the underlying SiNx geometry. The contribution of the suspended graphene area to capacitance which affects the noise level in the high frequency range reveals that the graphene free-standing film area influences noise level over a wide frequency region. In addition, the low-frequency noise demonstrates a weak dependency on salt concentration, in deviation from Hooge's relation. These findings and attendant analysis provide a systematic understanding of the noise characteristics and can serve as a guide to designing free-standing monolayer graphene nanopore devices.},

Docking of a protein-DNA complex onto a nanopore can provide ample observation time, and has enabled collection of analytic applications of biological nanopores, including DNA sequencing. However, the application of the same principle to solid-state nanopores is tempered by poor understanding of the docking process. Here, we elucidate the behavior of individual protein-DNA complexes docked onto a solid-state nanopore by monitoring the nanopore ionic current. Repeat docking of monovalent streptavidin-DNA complexes is found to produce ionic current blockades that fluctuate between discrete levels. We elucidate the roles of the protein plug and the DNA tether in the docking process, finding the docking configurations to determine the multitude of the current blockade levels, whereas the frequency of the current level switching is determined by the interactions between the molecules and the solid-state membrane. Finally, we prove the feasibility of using the nanopore docking principle for single-molecule sensing using solid-state nanopores by detecting conformational changes of a tethered DNA molecule from a random coil to an i-motif state.},

Here, we use DNA as a building material to create an atomistically determined molecular valve that can control when and which cargo is transported across a bilayer. The valve, which is made from seven concatenated DNA strands, can bind a specific ligand and, in response, undergo a nanomechanical change to open up the membrane-spanning channel. It is also able to distinguish with high selectivity the transport of small organic molecules that differ by the presence of a positively or negatively charged group. The DNA device could be used for controlled drug release and the building of synthetic cell-like or logic ionic networks.},

@article{Division1996,
	abstract = {We show that an electric field can drive single-stranded RNA and DNA molecules through a 2.6-nm diameter ion channel in a lipid bilayer membrane. Because the channel diameter can accommodate only a single strand of RNA or DNA, each polymer traverses the membrane as an extended chain that partially blocks the channel. The passage of each molecule is detected as a transient decrease of ionic current whose duration is proportional to polymer length. Channel blockades can therefore be used to measure polynu-cleotide length. With further improvements, the method could in principle provide direct, high-speed detection of the se-quence of bases in single molecules of DNA or RNA. Measurement of ionic current passing through single ion channels in biological membranes or planar lipid bilayers is routine in neurobiology and biophysics (1, 2). Although most such channels undergo voltage-or ligand-dependent gating (3, 4), several relatively large ion channels, including Staphylo-coccus aureus ␣-hemolysin (5, 6) and the mitochondrial volt-age-dependent anion channel (7, 8), can remain open for extended periods, thereby allowing continuous ionic current to flow across a lipid bilayer (9, 10). We reasoned that a trans-membrane voltage applied across a continuously open channel of appropriate size should draw polyanionic DNA or RNA molecules through the channel as extended linear chains whose presence would detectably reduce or block normal ionic flow. Such blockages should make it possible to use single channel recordings to characterize the length and, possibly, other characteristics of the polymer. Random coil polymers have previously been used to inves-tigate channel pore dimensions (8) and single channel current recordings show that small poly(ethylene glycol) polymers partition into channels formed by alamethicin (11) or S. aureus ␣-hemolysin (12, 13). Recent investigations show that proteins can also traverse a lipid bilayer by moving through protein translocating channels, presumably as unfolded, extended chains (14–18). While translocating a protein, such channels are electrically silent; they regain their ion permeability only after the translocating polypeptide has been cleared from the channel (18). The ionic conductance of large nuclear pore complexes is similarly reduced during translocation of tran-scription factors, although in this case the macromolecules are assumed to move through the nuclear pore in a folded state (19, 20). To determine whether nucleic acid polymers can be detected by single channel measurements, S. aureus ␣-hemolysin was used to form a single channel across a lipid bilayer separating two buffer-filled compartments (21). The ␣-hemolysin mono-mers spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers (9) and assemble to form heptameric transmembrane channels (6) that are 2.6 nm in diameter (L. Song, M. R. Hobaugh, C. Shustak, S.

Here, we present an extensive study of the low-frequency 1/f noise in the ionic current through graphene nanopores and compare it to noise levels in silicon nitride pore currents. We find that the 1/f noise magnitude is very high for graphene nanopores: typically two orders of magnitude higher than for silicon nitride pores. This is a drawback as it significantly lowers the signal-to-noise ratio in DNA translocation experiments. We evaluate possible explanations for these exceptionally high noise levels in graphene pores. From examining the noise for pores of different diameters and at various salt concentrations, we find that in contrast to silicon nitride pores, the 1/f noise in graphene pores does not follow Hooge's relation. In addition, from studying the dependence on the buffer pH, we show that the increased noise cannot be explained by charge fluctuations of chemical groups on the pore rim. Finally, we compare single and bilayer graphene to few-layer and multi-layer graphene and boron nitride (h-BN), and we find that the noise reduces with layer thickness for both materials, which suggests that mechanical fluctuations may be the underlying cause of the high 1/f noise levels in monolayer graphene nanopore devices.},

Here we describe a fast and simple approach for fabricating a single nanopore down to 2-nm in size with sub-nm precision, directly in solution, by controlling dielectric breakdown at the nanoscale.

A qualitative understanding of the process of SLB formation after exposure of small lipid vesicles to a hydrophilic support is now emerging. Recent studies have revealed a stunning variety of effects that can take place during this self-organization process. The ensemble of results in our group has revealed unprecedented insight into intermediates of the SLB-formation process and has helped to identify a number of parameters that are determinant for the lipid deposition on solid supports. The pathway of lipid deposition can be tuned by electrostatic interactions and by the presence of calcium. We emphasize the importance of the solid support in the SLB-formation process. Our results suggest that the molecular-level interaction between lipids and the solid support needs to be considered explicitly, to understand the rupture of vesicles and the formation of SLBs as well as to predict the properties of the resulting SLB. The impact of the SLB-formation process on the quality and the physical properties of the resulting SLB as well as implications for other types of surface-confined lipid bilayers are discussed.},

However, directly pulling glass capillary nanopore with diameter down to sub-10 nm is very difficult. So, post treatment is sometimes necessary. Herein, we demonstrate a facile and effective wet-chemical method to shrink the diameter of glass capillary nanopore from several tens of nanometers to sub-10 nm by disodium silicate hydrolysis. Its benefits for DNA translocation are investigated. The shrinking of glass capillary nanopore not only slows down DNA translocation, but also enhances DNA translocation signal and sign al-to-noise ratio significantly (102.9 for 6.4 nm glass nanopore, superior than 15 for a 3 nm silicon nitride nanopore). It also affects DNA translocation behaviors, making the approach and glass capillary nanopore platform promising for DNA translocation studies.},

	abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) gate the only conduits for nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotes. Their gate is formed by nucleoporins containing large intrinsically disordered domains with multiple phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG domains). In combination, these are hypothesized to form a structurally and chemically homogeneous network of random coils at the NPC center, which sorts macromolecules by size and hydrophobicity. Instead, we found that FG domains are structurally and chemically heterogeneous. They adopt distinct categories of intrinsically disordered structures in non-random distributions. Some adopt globular, collapsed coil configurations and are characterized by a low charge content. Others are highly charged and adopt more dynamic, extended coil conformations. Interestingly, several FG nucleoporins feature both types of structures in a bimodal distribution along their polypeptide chain. This distribution functionally correlates with the attractive or repulsive character of their interactions with collapsed coil FG domains displaying cohesion toward one another and extended coil FG domains displaying repulsion. Topologically, these bipartite FG domains may resemble sticky molten globules connected to the tip of relaxed or extended coils. Within the NPC, the crowding of FG nucleoporins and the segregation of their disordered structures based on their topology, dimensions, and cohesive character could force the FG domains to form a tubular gate structure or transporter at the NPC center featuring two separate zones of traffic with distinct physicochemical properties.},

	abstract = {DNA sequencing, i.e., the process of determining the succession of nucleotides on a DNA strand, has become a standard aid in biomedical research and is expected to revolutionize medicine. With the capability of handling single DNA molecules, nanopore technology holds high promises to become speedier in sequencing at lower cost than what are achievable with the commercially available optics- or semiconductor-based massively parallelized technologies. Despite tremendous progress made with biological and solid-state nanopores, high error rates and large uncertainties persist with the sequencing results. Here, we employ a nano-disk model to quantitatively analyze the sequencing process by examining the variations of ionic current when a DNA strand translocates a nanopore. Our focus is placed on signal-boosting and noise-suppressing strategies in order to attain the single-nucleotide resolution. Apart from decreasing pore diameter and thickness, it is crucial to also reduce the translocation speed and facilitate a stepwise translocation. Our best-case scenario analysis points to severe challenges with employing plain nanopore technology, i.e., without recourse to any signal amplification strategy, in achieving sequencing with the desired single-nucleotide resolution. A conceptual approach based on strand synthesis in the nanopore of the translocating DNA from single-stranded to double-stranded is shown to yield a 10-fold signal amplification. Although it involves no advanced physics and is very simple in mathematics, this simple model captures the essence of nanopore sequencing and is useful in guiding the design and operation of nanopore sequencing.},

This behaviour remains highly sought after on polymeric surfaces as a means to expedite diffusional search processes in molecular engineered systems. Here, we have reconstituted the two-dimensional diffusion of colloidal particles on a molecular brush surface. The surface is composed of phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups)-intrinsically disordered proteins that facilitate selective transport through nuclear pore complexes in eukaryotic cells. Local and ensemble-level experiments involving optical trapping using a photonic force microscope and particle tracking by video microscopy, respectively, reveal that 1-µm-sized colloidal particles bearing nuclear transport receptors called karyopherins can exhibit behaviour that varies from highly localized to unhindered two-dimensional diffusion. Particle diffusivity is controlled by varying the amount of free karyopherins in solution, which modulates the multivalency of Kap-binding sites within the molecular brush. We conclude that the FG Nups resemble stimuli-responsive molecular 'velcro', which can impart 'reduction of dimensionality' as a means of biomimetic transport control in artificial environments.},

In such systems, simultaneous optical measurements generally introduce significant parasitic noise in the electrical signal, which can severely reduce the instrument sensitivity, critically hindering the monitoring of single-molecule events in the ionic current traces. Here, we present design rules and describe simple adjustments to the experimental setup to mitigate the different noise sources encountered when integrating optical components to an electrical nanopore system. In particular, we address the contributions to the electrical noise spectra from illuminating the nanopore during ionic current recording and mitigate those effects through con-trol of the illumination source and the use of a PDMS layer on the SiN x membrane. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our noise minimization strategies by showing the detection of DNA transloca-tion events during membrane illumination with a signal-to-noise ratio of ∼10 at 10 kHz bandwidth. The instrumental guidelines for noise minimization that we report are applicable to a wide range of nanopore-based optofluidic systems and offer the possibility of enhancing the quality of synchronous optical and electrical signals obtained during single-molecule nanopore-based analysis.

	abstract = {Nucleocytoplasmic transport is tightly regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Among the thousands of molecules that cross the NPC, even very large ({\textgreater}15 nm) cargoes such as pathogens, mRNAs and pre-ribosomes can pass the NPC intact. For these cargoes, there is little quantitative understanding of the requirements for their nuclear import, especially the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localisation sequences (NLSs) and the effect of size on import efficiency. Here, we assayed nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17-36 nm, with tuneable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. We show that the requirements for nuclear transport can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC. Together, our results reveal key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells. Eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi, store the genetic material within their cells inside a specific compartment called the nucleus. Surrounding the nucleus is a protective membrane which molecules must pass across in order to reach the cell's DNA. Straddling the membrane are nuclear pore complexes, or NPCs for short, which act as the gatekeepers to the nucleus, shuttling thousands of different molecules back and forth whilst restricting access to others. Large cargoes need to have specific markers on their surface called nuclear localization signals in order to be transported by NPCs. Certain transporter proteins help the NPC carry large molecules across the membrane by binding to these signals. This generates the energy needed to overcome the barrier of transporting it across the membrane. Some viruses have nuclear localization signals of their own, which can exploit this transport system; these signals allow the virus to enter the nucleus and hijack the genetic machinery of the cell. It has been suggested that viruses have multiple copies of these surface signals to improve their chances of reaching the nucleus. However, it remained unclear how the number of nuclear localization signals affects the transport of large molecules into the nucleus. To answer this question, Paci et al. engineered a range of different sized particles derived from viral structures which had varying numbers of nuclear localization signals on their surface. These particles were inserted into human cell lines grown in the laboratory, and imaged to see how they were transported into the nucleus. The rate of nuclear transport was then measured for each particle, and this data was used to create a mathematical model. Paci et al. found that the larger the cargo, the more nuclear localization signals it needed to be efficiently transported across the membrane into the nucleus. This is because inserting big cargoes into the NPC requires more energy. Therefore, by increasing the number of surface signals transporter proteins can bind to, larger molecules are able to interact with the NPC and generate the energy required for crossing. These findings improve our current understanding of how nuclear transport could be hijacked by viruses. It could also help scientists who are developing targeted nanoparticles to deliver therapies for genetic conditions to the nucleus.},

Alternatively, Bayesian pooling methods using noninformative priors yield unrealistically large amounts of uncertainty in this case.

We also present an example of mortality risk due to long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter obtained from a small number of cohort studies conducted in the United States and Europe. We compare our new risk uncertainty distribution to that obtained by the integrated exposure-response (IER) model used in the Global Burden of Disease 2010 project for which risk was modeled over the entire global concentration range. We suggest a method to incorporate our new risk uncertainty distribution based on the relatively low concentrations observed in the United States and western Europe into the IER model, thus extending risk estimation to the global concentration range.},

	abstract = {Nucleocytoplasmic transport is sustained by karyopherins (Kaps) and a Ran guanosine triphosphate (RanGTP) gradient that imports nuclear localization signal (NLS)–specific cargoes (NLS-cargoes) into the nucleus. However, how nuclear pore complex (NPC) barrier selectivity, Kap traffic, and NLS-cargo release are systematically linked and simultaneously regulated remains incoherent. In this study, we show that Kap$\alpha$ facilitates Kap$\beta$1 turnover and occupancy at the NPC in a RanGTP-dependent manner that is directly coupled to NLS-cargo release and NPC barrier function. This is underpinned by the binding affinity of Kap$\beta$1 to phenylalanine–glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups), which is comparable with RanGTP{\textperiodcentered}Kap$\beta$1, but stronger for Kap$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}Kap$\beta$1. On this basis, RanGTP is ineffective at releasing standalone Kap$\beta$1 from NPCs. Depleting Kap$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}Kap$\beta$1 by RanGTP further abrogates NPC barrier function, whereas adding back Kap$\beta$1 rescues it while Kap$\beta$1 turnover softens it. Therefore, the FG Nups are necessary but insufficient for NPC barrier function. We conclude that Kaps constitute integral constituents of the NPC whose barrier, transport, and cargo release functionalities establish a continuum under a mechanism of Kap-centric control.},

Coupling a biological nanopore MspA to a DNA processing enzyme has made DNA sequencing via measurement of ionic current blockades possible. Nevertheless, the physical mechanism enabling the DNA sequence readout has remained undetermined. Here, we report the results of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations that elucidated the physical mechanism of ionic current blockades in the biological nanopore MspA. We find that the amount of water displaced from the nanopore by the DNA strand determines the nanopore ionic current, whereas the steric and base-stacking properties of the DNA nucleotides determine the amount of water displaced. Unexpectedly, we find the effective force on DNA in MspA to undergo large fluctuations, which may produce insertion errors in the DNA sequence readout.},

This study investigates the interactions between cranberry proanthocyanidins (CPAC) and human serum proteins (albumin, $\alpha$-1-acid glycoprotein, and fibrinogen) that may be encountered during CPAC metabolism following ingestion. To better understand how CPAC might interfere with bacterial infection, we also examined the interactions between CPAC and selected bacterial virulence factors; namely, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and rhamnolipid. The binding of CPAC to the serum proteins, rhamnolipids and LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4 can be described by Langmuir-type isotherms, allowing the determination of the apparent adsorption affinity constants, with CPAC interacting most strongly with fibrinogen with a binding constant of 2.2 × 10(8) M(-1). These binding interactions will limit the bioavailability of the CPAC at the site of action, an important consideration in designing further clinical trials. Furthermore, CPAC interacts with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10 LPS, E. coli O111:B4 LPS, and P. aeruginosa rhamnolipids in fundamentally different manners, supporting the theory that cranberry prevents bacterial infections via multiple mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The permeability barrier of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) controls bulk nucleocytoplasmic exchange. It consists of nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine motifs (FG domains). As a bottom-up nanoscale model for the permeability barrier, we have used planar films produced with three different end-grafted FG domains, and quantitatively analyzed the binding of two different nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), NTF2 and Importin $\beta$, together with the concomitant film thickness changes. NTR binding caused only moderate changes in film thickness; the binding isotherms showed negative cooperativity and could all be mapped onto a single master curve. This universal NTR binding behavior – a key element for the transport selectivity of the NPC – was quantitatively reproduced by a physical model that treats FG domains as regular, flexible polymers, and NTRs as spherical colloids with a homogeneous surface, ignoring the detailed arrangement of interaction sites along FG domains and on the NTR surface.The cells of animals, plants and other eukaryotic organisms contain a compartment called the nucleus that contains most of the cell's genetic material. Proteins and other molecules – collectively known as cargos – can enter and exit the nucleus via tiny channels in the membrane that surrounds and protects it. Receptor proteins – called nuclear transport receptors – bind to potential cargos and shuttle them through the channels.This selective transport process relies on the nuclear transport receptors being attracted to flexible, spaghetti-like proteins that are anchored to the walls on the inside of each channel. However, because of their flexible and disordered nature, these so-called FG domains are difficult to study, and the details of the transport process are poorly understood.Zahn, Osmanovi{\'{c}} et al. decided to study how the FG domains behave and what happens when they interact with nuclear transport receptors by using ultrathin films made of just the FG domains. This is a good model system because the films are easier to study than the whole channels, but are likely to retain the essential properties of the real barrier formed in the nuclear envelope. Zahn, Osmanovi{\'{c}} et al. compared the binding of two nuclear transport receptors of different sizes, taken from humans and yeast, to FG domain films made from one of three different FG domains. The experiments showed that the different nuclear transport receptors bind to the different FG domains in very similar ways.Zahn, Osmanovi{\'{c}} et al. then used a computational model that essentially represented the FG domains as sticky spaghetti and the nuclear transport receptors as perfectly round meatballs. This sticky-spaghetti-with-meatballs model reproduced the experimental data, implying that the exact chemical make-up and structure of the molecules may not be critical for controlling the transport of cargo across the nuclear envelope. Future studies will test whether the generic physical features of nuclear transport receptors and FG domains can indeed explain how the cargo molecules pass through the nuclear envelope.},

Membrane permeation, both natural and artificial, can take place via appearance of transversal pores. The rearrangements of lipids leading to pore formation in the intact membrane are not yet understood in details. We applied continuum elasticity theory to obtain continuous trajectory of pore formation and closure, and analyzed molecular dynamics trajectories of pre-formed pore reseal. We hypothesized that a transversal pore is preceded by a hydrophobic defect: intermediate structure spanning through the membrane, the side walls of which are partially aligned by lipid tails. This prediction was confirmed by our molecular dynamics simulations. Conversion of the hydrophobic defect into the hydrophilic pore required surmounting some energy barrier. A metastable state was found for the hydrophilic pore at the radius of a few nanometers. The dependence of the energy on radius was approximately quadratic for hydrophobic defect and small hydrophilic pore, while for large radii it depended on the radius linearly. The pore energy related to its perimeter, line tension, thus depends of the pore radius. Calculated values of the line tension for large pores were in quantitative agreement with available experimental data.},

The open channel noise exhibited 1/f-noise for frequencies up to 200 Hz. The 1/f-noise was investigated using the Hooge formula (Hooge, Phys. Lett. 29A: 139-140 (1969)), and the Hooge parameter alpha was calculated for all bacterial porins used in this study. The 1/f-noise was in part caused by slow inactivation and activation of porin channels. However, when care was taken that during the noise measurement no opening or closing of porin channels occurred, the Hooge Parameter alpha was a meaningful number for a given channel. A linear relationship was observed between alpha and the single-channel conductance, g, of the different porins. This linear relation between single-channel conductance and the Hooge parameter alpha could be qualitatively explained by assuming that the passing of an ion through a bacterial porin channel is-to a certain extent-influenced by nonlinear effects between channel wall and passing ion.},

However, the three-dimensional (3D) pathway taken by mRNPs as they transit through the NPC, and the kinetics and selectivity of transport, remain obscure. Here we employ single-molecule fluorescence microscopy with an unprecedented spatiotemporal accuracy of 8 nm and 2 ms to provide new insights into the mechanism of nuclear mRNP export in live human cells. We find that mRNPs exiting the nucleus are decelerated and selected at the centre of the NPC, and adopt a fast-slow-fast diffusion pattern during their brief, ∼12 ms, interaction with the NPC. A 3D reconstruction of the export route indicates that mRNPs primarily interact with the periphery on the nucleoplasmic side and in the centre of the NPC, without entering the central axial conduit utilized for passive diffusion of small molecules, and eventually dissociate on the cytoplasmic side. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

	abstract = {The transport channel of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) contains a high density of intrinsically disordered proteins that are rich in phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat motifs (FG Nups). The FG Nups interact promiscuously with various nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), such as karyopherins (Kaps), that mediate the trafficking of nucleocytoplasmic cargoes while also generating a selectively permeable barrier against other macromolecules. Although the binding of NTRs to FG Nups increases molecular crowding in the NPC transport channel, it is unclear how this impacts FG Nup barrier function or the movement of other molecules, such as the Ran importer NTF2. Here, we use surface plasmon resonance to evaluate FG Nup conformation, binding equilibria, and interaction kinetics associated with the multivalent binding of NTF2 and karyopherin$\beta$1 (Kap$\beta$1) to Nsp1p molecular brushes. NTF2 and Kap$\beta$1 show different long- and short-lived binding characteristics that emerge from varying degrees of molecular retention and FG repeat binding avidity within the Nsp1p brush. Physiological concentrations of NTF2 produce a collapse of Nsp1p brushes, whereas Kap$\beta$1 binding generates brush extension. However, the presence of prebound Kap$\beta$1 inhibits Nsp1p brush collapse during NTF2 binding, which is dominated by weak, short-lived interactions that derive from steric hindrance and diminished avidity with Nsp1p. This suggests that binding promiscuity confers kinetic advantages to NTF2 by expediting its facilitated diffusion and reinforces the proposal that Kap$\beta$1 contributes to the integral barrier function of the NPC.},

To better understand the structure-function relationship of nanopores, we are studying the ion-conducting properties of channels formed by wild-type and genetically engineered versions of Staphylococcus aureus $\alpha$-hemolysin ($\alpha$HL) reconstituted into planar lipid bilayer membranes. Specifically, we measured the ion selectivities and current-voltage relationships of channels formed with 24 different $\alpha$HL point cysteine mutants before and after derivatizing the cysteines with positively and negatively charged sulfhydryl-specific reagents. Novel negative charges convert the selectivity of the channel from weakly anionic to strongly cationic, and new positive charges increase the anionic selectivity. However, the extent of these changes depends on the channel radius at the position of the novel charge (predominately affects ion selectivity) or on the location of these charges along the longitudinal axis of the channel (mainly alters the conductance-voltage curve). The results suggest that the net charge of the pore wall is responsible for cation-anion selectivity of the $\alpha$HL channel and that the charge at the pore entrances is the main factor that determines the shape of the conductance-voltage curves. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

	abstract = {We developed a new, simple and robust approach for rapid screening of single molecule interactions with protein channels. Our glass nanopipets can be fabricated simply by drawing glass capillaries in a standard pipet puller, in a matter of minutes, and do not require further modification before use. Giant unilamellar vesicles break when in contact with the tip of the glass pipet and form a supported bilayer with typical seal resistances of similar to 140 G Omega, which is stable for hours and at applied potentials up to 900 mV. Bilayers can be formed, broken, and reformed more than 50 times using the same pipet enabling rapid screening of bilayers for single protein channels. The stability of the lipid bilayer is significantly superior to that of traditionally built bilayers supported by Teflon membranes, particularly against perturbation by electrical and mechanical forces. We demonstrate the functional reconstitution of the E. coli porin OmpF and a-hemolysin in a glass nanopipet supported bilayer. Interactions of the antibiotic enrofloxacin with the OmpF channel have been studied at the single-molecule level, demonstrating the ability of this method to detect single molecule interactions with protein channels. High-resolution conductance measurements of protein channels can be performed with low sample and buffer consumption. Glass nanopipet supported bilayers are uniquely suited for single-molecule studies as they are more rigid and the lifetime of a stable membrane is on the scale of hours, closer to that of natural cell membranes.},

To determine the molecular architecture of the yeast NPC, we collected a diverse set of biophysical and proteomic data, and developed a method for using these data to localize the NPC's 456 constituent proteins (see the accompanying paper). Our structure reveals that half of the NPC is made up of a core scaffold, which is structurally analogous to vesicle-coating complexes. This scaffold forms an interlaced network that coats the entire curved surface of the nuclear envelope membrane within which the NPC is embedded. The selective barrier for transport is formed by large numbers of proteins with disordered regions that line the inner face of the scaffold. The NPC consists of only a few structural modules that resemble each other in terms of the configuration of their homologous constituents, the most striking of these being a 16-fold repetition of ‘columns'. These findings provide clues to the evolutionary origins of the NPC.},

The magnitude of the force involved is of fundamental importance in understanding and exploiting this translocation mechanism, yet so far it has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate the first measurements of the force on a single DNA molecule in a solid-state nanopore by combining optical tweezers11 with ionic-current detection. The opposing force exerted by the optical tweezers can be used to slow down and even arrest the translocation of the DNA molecules. We obtain a value of 0.240.02 pN mV-1 for the force on a single DNA molecule, independent of salt concentration from 0.02 to 1 M KCl. This force corresponds to an effective charge of 0.500.05 electrons per base pair equivalent to a 75{\%} reduction of the bare DNA charge.},

Solid-state nanopores currently suffer from the drawback, however, that the channel constituting the pore is long, ∼100 times the distance between two bases in a DNA molecule (0.5 nm for single-stranded DNA). This paper provides proof of concept that it is possible to realize and use ultrathin nanopores fabricated in graphene monolayers for single-molecule DNA translocation. The pores are obtained by placing a graphene flake over a microsize hole in a silicon nitride membrane and drilling a nanosize hole in the graphene using an electron beam. As individual DNA molecules translocate through the pore, characteristic temporary conductance changes are observed in the ionic current through the nanopore, setting the stage for future single-molecule genomic screening devices. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Dynamic interactions with the cytoskeleton drive the movement and positioning of nuclei in many cell types. During muscle cell development, myoblasts fuse to form syncytial myofibers with nuclei positioned regularly along the length of the cell. Nuclear translocation in developing myotubes requires microtubules, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. We find that as nuclei actively translocate through the cell, they rotate in three-dimensions. The nuclear envelope, nucleoli, and chromocenters within the nucleus rotate together as a unit. Both translocation and rotation require an intact microtubule cytoskeleton, which forms a dynamic bipolar network around nuclei. The plus- and minus-end directed microtubule motor proteins, kinesin-1 and dynein, localize to the nuclear envelope in myotubes. Kinesin-1 localization is mediated at least in part by interaction with klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne homology (KASH) proteins. Depletion of kinesin-1 abolishes nuclear rotation and significantly inhibits nuclear translocation, resulting in the abnormal aggregation of nuclei at the midline of the myotube. Dynein depletion also inhibits nuclear dynamics, but to a lesser extent, leading to altered spacing between adjacent nuclei. Thus, oppositely directed motors acting from the surface of the nucleus drive nuclear motility in myotubes. The variable dynamics observed for individual nuclei within a single myotube likely result from the stochastic activity of competing motors interacting with a complex bipolar microtubule cytoskeleton that is also continuously remodeled as the nuclei move. The three-dimensional rotation of myotube nuclei may facilitate their motility through the complex and crowded cellular environment of the developing muscle cell, allowing for proper myonuclear positioning.},

Although results were comparable to those of previous reports, the existence of previously overlooked mass transport limitations was revealed. Additional experiments with a loss-of-interaction mutant variant demonstrated the existence of additional physical events and an uncharacterized binding mode.

Here, we combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with single-molecule experiments to investigate the utility of SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate) to unfold proteins for solid-state nanopore translocation, while simultaneously endowing them with a stronger electrical charge. Our simulations and experiments prove that SDS-treated proteins show a considerable loss of the protein structure during the nanopore translocation. Moreover, SDS-treated proteins translocate through the nanopore in the direction prescribed by the electrophoretic force due to the negative charge impaired by SDS. In summary, our results suggest that SDS causes protein unfolding while facilitating protein translocation in the direction of the electrophoretic force; both characteristics being advantageous for future protein sequencing applications using solid-state nanopores.},

Subsequently we discuss the conductance blockade $\Delta$G due to the insertion of a DNA molecule into the pore, which we study experimentally as a function of pore diameter.

	abstract = {The transport of biopolymers through large membrane channels is a ubiquitous process in biology. It is central to processes such as gene transfer by transduction andRNAtransport through nuclear pore complexes. The transport of polymers through nanoscopic channels is also of interest to physicists and chemists studying the effects of steric, hydrodynamic, and electrostatic interactions between polymers and confiningwalls. Single-channel ion current measurements have been recently used to study the transport of biopolymers, and in particular single-strandedDNAandRNAmolecules, through nanometre- size channels. Under the influence of an electric field, the negatively charged polynucleotides can be captured and drawn through the channel in a process termed ‘translocation'. During translocation, the ion current flowing through the channel is mostly blocked, indicating the presence of the polymer inside thechannel. The current blockadeswere found to be sensitive to the properties of the biopolymers such as their nucleotide composition, length, and secondary structure, and to physical parameters such as the driving field intensity, temperature, and ionic strength. Theseblockades are therefore a rich source of information regarding the dynamics of polynucleotides in the pore. The translocation process is separated into its twomain steps: (a) polymer ‘capture' in which one of the polymer's ends is threaded a small distance through the channel, and (b) polymer sliding through the channel. The experimental and theoretical efforts to elucidate polymer capture and the transport dynamics of biopolymers in nanoscopic pores are reviewed in this article.

	abstract = {We investigate the voltage-driven translocation dynamics of individual DNA molecules through solid-state nanopores in the diameter range 2.7-5 nm. Our studies reveal an order of magnitude increase in the translocation times when the pore diameter is decreased from 5 to 2.7 nm, and steep temperature dependence, nearly threefold larger than would be expected if the dynamics were governed by viscous drag. As previously predicted for an interaction-dominated translocation process, we observe exponential voltage dependence on translocation times. Mean translocation times scale with DNA length by two power laws: for short DNA molecules, in the range 150-3500 bp, we find an exponent of 1.40, whereas for longer molecules, an exponent of 2.28 dominates. Surprisingly, we find a transition in the fraction of ion current blocked by DNA, from a length-independent regime for short DNA molecules to a regime where the longer the DNA, the more current is blocked. Temperature dependence studies reveal that for increasing DNA lengths, additional interactions are responsible for the slower DNA dynamics. Our results can be rationalized by considering DNA/pore interactions as the predominant factor determining DNA translocation dynamics in small pores. These interactions markedly slow down the translocation rate, enabling higher temporal resolution than observed with larger pores. These findings shed light on the transport properties of DNA in small pores, relevant for future nanopore applications, such as DNA sequencing and genotyping. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

	abstract = {Nanopores and submicrometer pores have recently been explored for applications ranging from detection of single molecules, assemblies of nanoparticles, nucleic acids, occurrence of chemical reactions, and unfolding of proteins. Most of these applications rely on monitoring electrical current through these pores, hence the noise and signal bandwidth of these current recordings are critical for achieving accurate and sensitive measurements. In this report, we present a detailed theoretical and experimental study on the noise and signal bandwidth of current recordings from glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes that contain a single submicrometer pore or nanopore. We examined the theoretical signal bandwidth of two different pore geometries, and we measured the signal bandwidth of the electronics used to record the ionic current. We also investigated the theoretical noise generated by the substrate material, the pore, and the electronics used to record the current. Employing a combination of theory and experimental results, we were able to predict the noise in current traces recorded from glass and PET pores with no applied voltage with an error of less than 12{\%} in a range of signal bandwidths from 1 to 40 kHz. In approximately half of all experiments, application of a voltage did not significantly increase the noise. In the other half of experiments, however, application of a voltage resulted in an additional source of noise. For these pores, predictions of the noise were usually still accurate within 35{\%} error at signal bandwidths of at least 10 kHz. The power spectra of this extra noise suggested a 1/f(alpha) origin with best fits to the power spectrum for alpha = 0.4-0.8. This work provides the theoretical background and experimental data for understanding the bandwidth requirements and the main sources of noise in current recordings; it will be useful for minimizing noise and achieving accurate recordings.},

Here we report a new technique for fabricating silicon oxide nanopores with single-nanometre precision and direct visual feedback, using state-of-the-art silicon technology and transmission electron microscopy. First, a pore of 20 nm is opened in a silicon membrane by using electron-beam lithography and anisotropic etching. After thermal oxidation, the pore can be reduced to a single-nanometre when it is exposed to a high-energy electron beam. This fluidizes the silicon oxide leading to a shrinking of the small hole due to surface tension. When the electron beam is switched off, the material quenches and retains its shape. This technique dramatically increases the level of control in the fabrication of a wide range of nanodevices.},

We demonstrate that the ionic current through the engineered Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A, MspA, has the ability to distinguish all four DNA nucleotides and resolve single-nucleotides in single-stranded DNA when double-stranded DNA temporarily holds the nucleotides in the pore constriction. Passing DNA with a series of double-stranded sections through MspA provides proof of principle of a simple DNA sequencing method using a nanopore.

The process of bubble coalescence was obsd. as a function of time. The macroscopic contact angle, measured with respect to the aq. or gas phase, is very different from the microscopic contact angle detected by TMAFM and appears to be due to the influence of line tension at the pinned three-phase contact line.

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin opens an ion channel in planar phospholipid bilayers which is selective for anions over cations, supposedly because of the presence of positively charged groups along the ion pathway. To remove some positive charges of this protein toxin, we chemically modified part of its lysine residues either with diethylpyrocarbonate, followed by histidine regeneration with hydroxylamine, or with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. The extent of chemical modification can be followed accurately by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Ethoxyformilation of two to three lysine residues per toxin monomer does not impair hemolysis of rabbit red blood cells nor formation of pores in model membranes. It reduces the conductance and the anion selectivity of the channel and changes the shape of its current-voltage characteristic. This indicates that positively charged lysine residues are actually important in determining the electrical properties of the pore. Ethoxyformilation of channels preassembled in planar bilayers produces the same changes as modification of toxin monomers before channel formation. Furthermore, it can be performed by adding diethylpyrocarbonate on either side of the bilayer. This suggests that the lysine residues relevant for the electrical properties of the pore are located inside its lumen where they can be reached by diethylpyrocarbonate diffusing from either entrance of the channel.},

While biological nanopores have recently shown the ability to resolve single nucleotides within individual DNA molecules, similar developments with solid-state nanopores have lagged, due to challenges both in fabricating stable nanopores of similar dimensions as biological nanopores and in achieving sufficiently low-noise and high-bandwidth recordings. Here we show that small silicon nitride nanopores (0.8- to 2-nm diameter in 5- to 8-nm-thick membranes) can resolve differences between ionic current signals produced by short (30 base) ssDNA homopolymers (poly(dA), poly(dC), poly(dT)), when combined with measurement electronics that allow a signal-to-noise ratio of better than 10 to be achieved at 1-MHz bandwidth. While identifying intramolecular DNA sequences with silicon nitride nanopores will require further improvements in nanopore sensitivity and noise levels, homopolymer differentiation represents an important milestone in the development of solid-state nanopores. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

We previously proposed a "selective phase model" in which the FG repeats interact with one another to form a sieve-like barrier that can be locally disrupted by the binding of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), but not by inert macromolecules, allowing selective passage of NTRs and associated cargo. Here, we provide direct evidence for this model in a physiological context. By using NPCs reconstituted from Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we show that Nup98 is essential for maintaining the permeability barrier. Specifically, the multivalent cohesion between FG repeats is required, including cohesive FG repeats close to the anchorage point to the NPC scaffold. Our data exclude alternative models that are based solely on an interaction between the FG repeats and NTRs and indicate that the barrier is formed by a sieve-like FG hydrogel. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Recently, the desire to increase structural resolution and analytical throughput has led to the integration of additional detection methods such as fluorescence spectroscopy. For structural information to be probed electronically high bandwidth measurements are crucial due to the high translocation velocity of molecules. The most commonly used solid-state nanopore sensors consist of a silicon nitride membrane and bulk silicon substrate. Unfortunately, the photoinduced noise associated with illumination of these platforms limits their applicability to high-bandwidth, high-laser-power synchronized optical and electronic measurements. Here we present a unique low-noise nanopore platform, composed of a predominately Pyrex substrate and silicon nitride membrane, for synchronized optical and electronic detection of biomolecules. Proof of principle experiments are conducted showing that the Pyrex substrates have substantially lowers ionic current noise arising from both laser illumination and platform capacitance. Furthermore, using confocal microscopy and a partially metallic pore we demonstrate high signal-to-noise synchronized optical and electronic detection of dsDNA.},

	abstract = {Single nanopore electrodes and nanopore electrode arrays have been fabricated using a focused ion beam (FIB) method. High aspect ratio pores (approximately 150-400-nm diameter and 500-nm depth) were fabricated using direct-write local ion milling of a silicon nitride layer over a buried platinum electrode. This local milling results in formation of a recessed platinum electrode at the base of each nanopore. The electrochemical properties of these nanopore metal electrodes have been characterized by voltammetry. Steady-state voltammograms were obtained for a range of array sizes as well as for single nanopore electrodes. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy imaging of the arrays showed that the pores had truncated cone, rather than cylindrical, conformations. A mathematical model describing diffusion to an electrode located at the base of a truncated conical pore was developed and applied to the analysis of the electrode geometries. The results imply that diffusion to the pore mouth is the dominant mass transport process rather than diffusion to the electrode surface at the base of the truncated cone. FIB milling thus represents a simple and convenient method for fabrication of prototype nanopore electrode arrays, with scope for applications in sensing and fundamental electrochemical studies.},

	abstract = {In biological systems, polymeric materials block the movement of some macromolecules while allowing the selective passage of others. In some cases, binding enables selective transport, while in others the most inert particles appear to transit most rapidly. To study the general principles of filtering, we develop a model motivated by features of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) which are highly conserved and could potentially be applied to other biological systems. The NPC allows selective transport of proteins called transport factors which transiently bind to disordered, flexible proteins called FG Nups. While the NPC is tuned for transport factors and their cargo, we show that a single feature is sufficient for selective transport: the bound-state motion resulting from transient binding to flexible filaments. Interchain transfer without unbinding can further improve selectivity, especially for crosslinked chains. We generalize this observation to model nanoparticle transport through mucus and show that bound-state motion accelerates transport of transient nanoparticle application, even with clearance by mucus flow. Our model provides a framework to control binding-induced selective transport in bipolymeric materials.},

Previous methods of pore production in other 2D materials typically create pores with irregular geometry and imprecise diameters. In contrast, other studies have shown that with careful control of electron irradiation, defects in h-BN grow with pristine zig-zag edges at quantized triangular sizes, but they have failed to demonstrate production and control of isolated defects. In this work, we combine these techniques to yield a method in which we can create individual size-quantized triangular nanopores through an h-BN sheet. The pores are created using the electron beam of a conventional transmission electron microscope; which can strip away multiple layers of h-BN exposing single-layer regions, introduce single vacancies, and preferentially grow vacancies only in the single-layer region. We further demonstrate how the geometry of these pores can be altered beyond triangular by changing beam conditions. Precisely size- and geometry-tuned nanopores could find application in molecular sensing, DNA sequencing, water desalination, and molecular separation.},

The results indicate a good agreement in protein layer thickness between AFM and ellipsometry when the protein film refractive index Nfilm = 1.5 -0i, although then the calculated surface mass density from the ellipsometry data became grossly overestimated by the Cuypers one-component formula. A good agreement in the surface mass density was obtained when the M/A ratio in this formula was lowered from 4.14 to 2.35.

Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, we identified several distinct modes of spatiotemporal patterns inside spherical GUVs. For osmotically deflated GUVs, the vesicle shape actively changed in concert with the Min oscillations. The periodic relocation of Min proteins from the vesicle lumen to the membrane and back is accompanied by drastic changes in the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer. In particular, two types of oscillating membrane-shape changes are highlighted: 1) GUVs that repeatedly undergo fission into two connected compartments and fusion of these compartments back into a dumbbell shape and 2) GUVs that show periodic budding and subsequent merging of the buds with the mother vesicle, accompanied by an overall shape change of the vesicle reminiscent of a bouncing ball. These findings demonstrate how reaction–diffusion-based protein self-organization can directly yield visible mechanical effects on membrane compartments, even up to autonomous division, without the need for coupling to cytoskeletal elements.},

For all three polymers, despite their different structures, samples with Rh {\textless}4 nm were found to inhibit aggregation, whereas those with Rh {\textgreater}4 nm enhanced aggregation. Inhibition increased with Rh and was maximal at ∼3 nm; above 4 nm the pro-aggregant effect increased with Rh. For comparison, the R h of 12 plasma proteins were calculated from literature values of intrinsic viscosity or diffusion coefficient. Each protein known to promote RBC aggregation had Rh {\textgreater}4 nm, whereas those with Rh {\textless}4 nm either inhibited or had no effect on aggregation. These results suggest that the influence of a nonionic polymer or plasma protein on RBC aggregation is simply a consequence of its size in an aqueous environment, and that the specific type of macromolecule is of minor importance.},

Here, we show that the precise shape of small nanopores (approximately 5 nm diameter in 20 nm SiN membranes) can be controlled by using transmission electron microscope (TEM) beams of different sizes. However, when some of these small nanopores are immersed in an aqueous solution, their resistance is observed to decrease over time. By comparing nanopores of different shapes using (scanning) TEM both before and after immersion in aqueous solution, we demonstrate that the stability of small nanopores is related to their three-dimensional geometry, which depends on the TEM beam size employed during pore fabrication. Optimal stability is obtained using a TEM beam size of approximately the same size as the intended nanopore diameter. In addition, we show that thermal oxidation can serve as a means to independently control nanopore size following TEM fabrication. These observations provide key guidelines for the fabrication of stable solid-state nanopores on the scale of nucleic acids and small proteins.},

The combination of nanopore sensing and nucleic acid aptamer recognition comes close to this ideal due to the ease of multiplexing, without the need for expensive labelling methods or extensive sample pre-treatment. Here, we demonstrate a fully flexible, scalable and low-cost detection platform to sense multiple protein targets simultaneously by grafting specific sequences along the backbone of a double-stranded DNA carrier. Protein bound to the aptamer produces unique ionic current signatures which facilitates accurate target recognition. This powerful approach allows us to differentiate individual protein sizes via characteristic changes in the sub-peak current. Furthermore, we show that by using DNA carriers it is possible to perform single-molecule screening in human serum at ultra-low protein concentrations.},

	abstract = {Inspired by selectively filtering system of the nucleus, we developed biosynthetic system that can selectively “catch-trap” biotoxins from aqueous environment. Inspired by selective molecular transport in the nuclear pore complex, a system that can separate proteins using a facilitated diffusion-based mechanism is developed. The system is comprised of two components: nuclear transporter receptors (NTRs) fused with a peptide tag that can “catch” target biomolecules and a nucleoporin-like protein (NLP) hydrogel that can selectively “trap” target molecule-NTR complexes due to the physical binding between hydrophobic Phe-Gly sequences in the protein polymer network and the NTR. Similar to the nuclear pore complex, substrate selectivity is achieved via complexation with NTRs, which permits transport into the gel, whereas environmental proteins are rejected. The NLP hydrogel effectively transports cargo complexes down to the single nanomolar range in the environment, and a selectivity of approximately 300 can be achieved between target molecule and protein impurity. High selectivity requires both interactions between the hydrogel and cargo complex for efficient “catching” as well as high NLP gel concentration to reduce the pore size for rejecting environmental molecules. As a proof of concept of “catch-trap” for a protein target, a partial green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) toxoid are both separated from protein mixtures using engineered NTRs that contain binding tags for the corresponding protein. This represents a versatile system for fusing nuclear transporters with diverse peptide tags, enabling the selective binding and transport of a wide variety of separations of high value biomolecules. },

Although the structure of its scaffold is being revealed in increasing detail, its transport functionality depends upon an assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins (called FG-Nups) anchored inside the pore's central channel, which have hitherto eluded structural characterization. Here, using high-resolution atomic force microscopy, we provide a structural and nanomechanical analysis of individual NPCs. Our data highlight the structural diversity and complexity at the nuclear envelope, showing the interplay between the lamina network, actin filaments, and the NPCs. It reveals the dynamic behaviour of NPC scaffolds and displays pores of varying sizes. Of functional importance, the NPC central channel shows large structural diversity, supporting the notion that FG-Nup cohesiveness is in a range that facilitates collective rearrangements at little energetic cost. Finally, different nuclear transport receptors are shown to interact in qualitatively different ways with the FG-Nups, with particularly strong binding of importin-$\beta$.},

It is one of the established, promising and sustainable low-input soil management ventures. An improved understanding of the eco-physiological relationships between the arable and perennials in this system could contribute to solving issues of sustainability for nutrient use and system productivity. Field experiments were conducted in Alabata and Ajibode, located in the derived savannah zone of Nigeria, to evaluate the comparative effects of an alley cropping system, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation and cassava intercropping on maize yield. These on-farms trials (research managed and farmer managed) were conducted in the 1993/94 and 1995/96 growing seasons, in Rhodic Kandiustalf soil type with low nutrients. Each trial was a split-plot factorial arranged in randomized complete blocks with three replications. Biomass productions of maize and cassava tuber yield were determined. The results obtained at Alabata indicated that the maize plants were heavily infected with AM fungi whether inoculated or not. The hedgerow trees did not have a significant effect on maize yield. The increase in yield brought about by the alley cropping system was generally less than 15{\%}, except in one farm where increases of 34.6 and 46.5{\%} were recorded in AM-inoculated and non-inoculated plots respectively. The introduced AM fungi did not significantly enhance maize yield at Alabata; the percentage increase was not more than 24{\%}. This trend was also observed at Ajibode. Cassava tuber yield was found to be suppressed by the alley cropping system irrespective of the cultivar. The decrease in yield ranged from 2.6 to 150.8{\%}. However, inoculation of the cassava with exotic AM fungi brought about an enhancement of its tuber production. The increase ranged from 20.7 to 189.8{\%} depending on the treatment combination. It is therefore necessary to encourage adoption of the improved alley cropping system integrated with mycorrhizal technology.},

However, how nuclear pore complex (NPC) barrier selectivity, Kap traffic, and NLS-cargo release are systematically linked and simultaneously regulated remains incoherent. In this study, we show that Kap$\alpha$ facilitates Kap$\beta$1 turnover and occupancy at the NPC in a RanGTP-dependent manner that is directly coupled to NLS-cargo release and NPC barrier function. This is underpinned by the binding affinity of Kap$\beta$1 to phenylalanine–glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups), which is comparable with RanGTP{\textperiodcentered}Kap$\beta$1, but stronger for Kap$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}Kap$\beta$1. On this basis, RanGTP is ineffective at releasing standalone Kap$\beta$1 from NPCs. Depleting Kap$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}Kap$\beta$1 by RanGTP further abrogates NPC barrier function, whereas adding back Kap$\beta$1 rescues it while Kap$\beta$1 turnover softens it. Therefore, the FG Nups are necessary but insufficient for NPC barrier function. We conclude that Kaps constitute integral constituents of the NPC whose barrier, transport, and cargo release functionalities establish a continuum under a mechanism of Kap-centric control.},

On the microfluidic chip, droplets were perfused with different transport-competent or -incompetent cargo complexes, and then the permeability barrier properties of the droplets were optically interrogated. We show that the liquid state mimics permeability barrier properties of the physiological nuclear transport pathway in intact NPCs in cells: that is, inert cargoes ranging from small proteins to large capsids were excluded from liquid FG-Nup droplets, but functional import complexes underwent facilitated import into droplets. Collectively, these data provide an experimental model of how NPCs can facilitate fast passage of cargoes across an order of magnitude in cargo size.},

From pH 1 to pH 12, channel transport properties displayed three characteristic regimes. First, in acidic solutions, channel conductance is a strong function of pH; it increases by approximately threefold as the proton concentration decreases from pH 1 to pH 5. This rise in conductance is accompanied by a sharp increase in cation transport number and by pronounced open-channel low-frequency current noise with a peak at ∼pH 2.5. Random stepwise transients with amplitudes at ∼1/5 of the monomer conductance are major contributors to this noise. Second, over the middle range (pH 5 ÷ pH 9), channel conductance and selectivity stay virtually constant; open channel noise is at its minimum. Third, over the basic range (pH 9 ÷ pH 12), channel conductance and cation selectivity start to grow again with an onset of a higher frequency open-channel noise. We attribute these effects to the reversible protonation of channel residues whose pH-dependent charge influences transport by direct interactions with ions passing through the channel.},

This specific permeation is thought to depend on interactions between hydrophobic patches on NTRs and phenylalanine-glycine (FG) or related repeats that line the NPC. Here, we tested this premise directly by conjugating different hydrophobic amino-acid analogues to the surface of an inert protein and examining its ability to cross NPCs unassisted by NTRs. Conjugation of as few as four hydrophobic moieties was sufficient to enable passage of the protein through NPCs. Transport of the modified protein proceeded with rates comparable to those measured for the innate protein when bound to an NTR and was relatively insensitive both to the nature and density of the amino acids used to confer hydrophobicity. The latter observation suggests a non-specific, small, and plant interaction network between cargo and FG repeats.},

To date, experimentally investigated solid-state nanopores have been shown to adopt an approximately circular shape. In this Letter, we investigate the geometrical effect of the nanopore shape on ionic blockage induced by DNA translocation using triangular h-BN nanopores and approximately circular molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanopores. We observe a striking geometry- dependent ion scattering effect, which is further corroborated by a modified ionic blockage model. The well-acknowledged ionic blockage model is derived from uniform ion permeability through the 2D nanopore plane and hemisphere like access region in the nanopore vicinity. On the basis of our experimental results, we propose a modified ionic blockage model, which is highly related to the ionic profile caused by geometrical variations. Our findings shed light on the rational design of 2D nanopores and should be applicable to arbitrary nanopore shapes.},

The Si substrate of a fabricated Si-substrate-based silicon nitride (Si3N4) membrane was replaced with a polymer substrate. As such, laser machining was used to make a micro-size hole through the polyimide (PI) substrate, and a thin Si3N4 membrane was then transferred onto the PI substrate. Finally, a nanopore was formed in the membrane using a transmission electron microscope for detection of biomolecules. Compared to the Si-substrate-based device, the dielectric noise was greatly reduced and the root-mean-square noise level was decreased from 146.7 to 5.4 pA. Using this device, the translocation of double-strand deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected with a high signal/noise (S/N) ratio. This type of device is anticipated to be available for future versatile sequencing technologies.},

	abstract = {Molecular traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Hundreds, if not thousands, of molecules interact with and transit through each NPC every second. The pore is blocked by a permeability barrier, which consists of a network of intrinsically unfolded polypeptides containing thousands of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat motifs. This FG-network rejects larger molecules and admits smaller molecules or cargos bound to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). For a cargo transport complex, minimally consisting of a cargo molecule plus an NTR, access to the permeability barrier is provided by interactions between the NTR and the FG repeat motifs. Numerous models have been postulated to explain the controlled accessibility and the transport characteristics of the FG-network, but the amorphous, flexible nature of this structure has hindered characterization. A relatively recent development is the ability to monitor the real-time movement of single molecules through individual NPCs via single molecule fluorescence (SMF) microscopy. A major advantage of this approach is that it can be used to continuously monitor a series of specific molecular interactions in an active pore with millisecond time resolution, which therefore allows one to distinguish between kinetic and thermodynamic control. Novel insights and prospects for the future are outlined in this review.

Recreating the functional principle of such systems and extending it beyond physiological ionic cargo is both scientifically exciting and technologically relevant to sensing or drug release. However, fabricating synthetic channels with a predictable structure remains a significant challenge. Here, we use DNA as a building material to create an atomistically determined molecular valve that can control when and which cargo is transported across a bilayer. The valve, which is made from seven concatenated DNA strands, can bind a specific ligand and, in response, undergo a nanomechanical change to open up the membrane-spanning channel. It is also able to distinguish with high selectivity the transport of small organic molecules that differ by the presence of a positively or negatively charged group. The DNA device could be used for controlled drug release and the building of synthetic cell-like or logic ionic networks.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Solid-state nanopores (ssNPs) are extremely versatile single-molecule sensors and their potential have been established in numerous biomedical applications. However, the fabrication of ssNPs remains the main bottleneck to their widespread use. Herein, we introduce a rapid and localizable ssNPs fabrication method based on feedback-controlled optical etching. We show that a focused blue laser beam irreversibly etches silicon nitride (SiNx) membranes in solution. Furthermore, photoluminescence (PL) emitted from the SiNxis used to monitor the etching process in real-time, hence permitting rate adjustment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the etched area reveal an inverted Gaussian thickness profile, corresponding to the intensity point spread function of the laser beam. Continued laser exposure leads to the opening of a nanopore, which can be controlled to reproducibly fabricate nanopores of different sizes. The optically-formed ssNPs exhibit electrical noise on par with TEM-drilled pores, and translocate DNA and proteins readily. Notably, due to the localized thinning, the laser-drilled ssNPs exhibit highly suppressed background PL and improved spatial resolution. Given the total control over the nanopore position, this easily implemented method is ideally suited for electro-optical sensing and opens up the possibility of fabricating large nanopore arrays in situ.},

The grafting process, the resulting brushes, and the resistance toward biomolecular adsorption are investigated by surface plasmon resonance, quartz crystal microbalance, and atomic force microscopy. We determine both grafting density and thickness independently and use narrow molecular weight distributions which result in well-defined brushes. High density (e.g., 0.4 coils per nm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for 10 kDa) and thick (40 nm for 20 kDa) brushes are readily achieved that suppress adsorption from complete serum (10× dilution, exposure for 50 min) by up to 99{\%} on gold (down to 4 ng/cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} protein coverage). The brushes outperform oligo(ethylene glycol) monolayers prepared on the same surfaces and analyzed in the same manner. The brush heights are in agreement with calculations based on a simple model similar to the de Gennes "strongly stretched" brush, where the height is proportional to molecular weight. This result has so far generally been considered to be possible only for brushes prepared by grafting-from. Our results are consistent with the theory that the brushes act as kinetic barriers rather than efficient prevention of adsorption at equilibrium. We suggest that the free energy barrier for passing the brush depends on both monomer concentration and thickness. The extraordinary simplicity of the method and good inert properties of the brushes should make our results widely applicable in biointerface science.},

It binds the import substrate in the cytosol, and the resulting trimeric complex moves through the nuclear pores, probably as a single entity. Importin-$\alpha$ provides the nuclear localization signal binding site, importin-$\beta$ the site of initial docking to the pore. Here we show that the conserved, basic N-terminus of importin-$\alpha$ is sufficient for importin-$\beta$ binding and essential for protein import. The fusion product of this 41 amino acid domain to a heterologous protein is transported into the nucleus in the same way as full-length importin-$\alpha$ itself. Transport is dependent on importin-$\beta$ but competed by importin-$\alpha$. As no additional part of importin-$\alpha$ is needed for translocation, the movement which drives the import substrate complex into the nucleus appears to be generated between importin-$\beta$ and structures of the nuclear pore. The domain that binds to importin-$\beta$ appears to confer import only, but not re-export out of the nucleus, suggesting that the return of importin-$\alpha$ into the cytoplasm is not a simple reversal of its entry.},

A selective permeability barrier that arises from a supramolecular assembly of intrinsically unfolded nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine dipeptides (FG domains) fills the nuclear pore. There is increasing evidence that selective transport requires cohesive FG domain interactions. To understand the functional roles of cohesive interactions, we studied monolayers of end-grafted FG domains as a bottom-up nanoscale model system of the permeability barrier. Based on detailed physicochemical analysis of the model films and comparison of the data with polymer theory, we propose that cohesiveness is tuned to promote rapid assembly of the permeability barrier and to generate a stable and compact pore-filling meshwork with a small mesh size. Our results highlight the functional importance of weak interactions, typically a few kBT per chain, and contribute important information to understand the mechanism of size-selective transport. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

However, our understanding of these structures and our ability to synthesize models of them have been limited. We present design rules for IDPs possessing SLCs that phase separate into diverse assemblies within droplet microenvironments. Using theoretical analyses, we interpret the phase behaviour of archetypal IDP sequences and demonstrate the rational design of a vast library of multicomponent protein-rich structures that ranges from uniform nano-, meso- and microscale puncta (distinct protein droplets) to multilayered orthogonally phase-separated granular structures. The ability to predict and program IDP-rich assemblies in this fashion offers new insights into (1) genetic-to-molecular-to-macroscale relationships that encode hierarchical IDP assemblies, (2) design rules of such assemblies in cell biology and (3) molecular-level engineering of self-assembled recombinant IDP-rich materials.},

Intracellular organelles are either membrane-bound vesicles or membrane-less compartments that are made up of proteins and RNA. These organelles play key biological roles, by compartmentalizing the cell to enable spatiotemporal control of biological reactions. Recent studies suggest that membrane-less intracellular compartments are multicomponent viscous liquid droplets that form via phase separation. Proteins that have an intrinsic tendency for being conformationally heterogeneous seem to be the main drivers of liquid-liquid phase separation in the cell. These findings highlight the relevance of classical concepts from the physics of polymeric phase transitions for understanding the assembly of intracellular membrane-less compartments. However, applying these concepts is challenging, given the heteropolymeric nature of protein sequences, the complex intracellular environment, and non-equilibrium features intrinsic to cells.

The contact angle could be distorted by the calculation method used for the nonideal APTES SAM surface. Values calculated by the tangent-leaning method were thought to be more accurate and credible. Our findings demonstrated that static advancing contact angles were the most stable and credible for characterizing the APTES SAM surface wettability.},

However, this is particularly difficult when the particles are larger than the gel's characteristic mesh size because such particles cannot passively pass through the gel. Thus, filtering requires the interacting particles to transiently reorganize the gel's internal structure. While significant advances, e.g., in DNA engineering, have enabled the design of nano-materials with programmable interactions, it is not clear what physical principles such a designer gel could exploit to achieve selective permeability. We present an equilibrium mechanism where crosslink binding dynamics are affected by interacting particles such that particle diffusion is enhanced. In addition to revealing specific design rules for manufacturing selective gels, our results have the potential to explain the origin of selective permeability in certain biological materials, including the nuclear pore complex.},

Iterative operation of this algorithm causes both the moving average of the baseline current and its standard deviation to converge to their correct values. We explain different approaches to selecting events and building event populations, and we show the value of keeping track of the changes in parameters, such as the event rate and the pore resistance, throughout the course of the experiment.

Our recent work on the yeast NPC has revealed a simple modularity in its architecture and suggested a common evolutionary origin of the NPC and vesicle coating complexes in a progenitor protocoatomer. However, detailed compositional and structural information is currently only available for vertebrate and yeast NPCs, which are evolutionarily closely related. Hence our understanding of NPC composition in a full evolutionary context is sparse. Moreover despite the ubiquitous nature of the NPC, sequence searches in distant taxa have identified surprisingly few NPC components, suggesting that much of the NPC may not be conserved. Thus, to gain a broad perspective on the origins and evolution of the NPC, we performed proteomics analyses of NPC-containing fractions from a divergent eukaryote (Trypanosoma brucei) and obtained a comprehensive inventory of its nucleoporins. Strikingly trypanosome nucleoporins clearly share with metazoa and yeast their fold type, domain organization, composition, and modularity. Overall these data provide conclusive evidence that the majority of NPC architecture is indeed conserved throughout the Eukaryota and was already established in the last common eukaryotic ancestor. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that NPCs share a common ancestry with vesicle coating complexes and that both were established very early in eukaryotic evolution.},

This has relevance in biology and in designing surfaces with desired chemical and viscoelastic properties for nano and genomic technology applications. Agarose and thiol-tagged poly(ethylene glycol) were chosen as model systems, as they are known, on adsorption, to behave like a molecular gel and brush, respectively. Here, we focus on their viscoelastic differences using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Changes in resonance frequency and dissipation for three overtones using QCM-D were fitted with the Voigt viscoelastic model to calculate the shear viscosity and shear modulus for the adsorbed agarose gel and the PEG brush. At a surface coverage of 500 ng/cm 2, the shear viscosities and shear moduli were 0.0025 ± 0.0002 Pa-s and 2.0 ± 0.17 × 105 Pa and 0.0010 ± 0.0001 Pa-s and 5.0 ± 0.3 × 104 Pa for the gel and brush, respectively. Thus, the adsorbed agarose gel layer was far more rigid than that of the covalently bound PEG brush due to its cross-linked network. Also, the diffusivity of agarose and PEG in solution was compared during adsorption onto a bare gold surface. The estimated value for the effective diffusivity of the PEG (without a thiol tag) and of the agarose gel was on the order of 10 -11 and 10-15 m2/s, respectively. This low diffusivity for agarose supports the contention that it exists as a molecular gel with a H-bonded cross-linked network in aqueous solution. With the methods used here, it is relatively easy to distinguish the differences in viscoelastic properties between an adsorbed gel and brush. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

Bead Halo uncovered novel interactions between the importin Kap95 and the nucleoporins (nups) Nic96, Pom34, Gle1, Ndc1, Nup84, and Seh1, which likely occur during nuclear pore complex biogenesis. Bead Halo was also used to characterize the molecular determinants for binding between Kap95 and the family of nups that feature multiple phenylalanine-glycine motifs (FG nups). Binding was sensitive to the number of FG motifs present and to amino acid (AA) residues immediately flanking the FG motifs. Also, binding was reduced but not abolished when phenylalanine residues in all FG motifs were replaced by tyrosine or tryptophan. These results suggest flexibility in the binding pockets of Kap95 and synergism in binding FG motifs. The hypothesis that Nup53 and Nup59 bind directly to membranes through a C-terminal amphipathic alpha helix and to DNA via an RNA recognition motif domain was also tested and validated using Bead Halo. The results support a role for these nups in nuclear pore membrane biogenesis and in gene expression. Finally, Bead Halo detected binding of the nups Gle1, Nup60, and Nsp1 to phospholipid bilayers. This may reflect the known interaction between Gle1 and phosphoinositides and suggests similar interactions for Nup60 and Nsp1. As the Bead Halo assay detected molecular interactions in cell lysates, as well as between purified components, it can be adapted for large-scale proteomic studies using automated robotics and microscopy.},

NPC-associated proteins containing phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG nups) have large, flexible, unstructured proteinaceous regions, and line the NPC. A central feature of NPC-mediated transport is the binding of cargo-carrying soluble transport factors to the unstructured regions of FG nups. Here, we model the dynamics of nucleocytoplasmic transport as diffusion in an effective potential resulting from the interaction of the transport factors with the flexible FG nups, using a minimal number of assumptions consistent with the most well-established structural and functional properties of NPC transport. We discuss how specific binding of transport factors to the FG nups facilitates transport, and how this binding and competition between transport factors and other macromolecules for binding sites and space inside the NPC accounts for the high selectivity of transport. We also account for why transport is relatively insensitive to changes in the number and distribution of FG nups in the NPC, providing an explanation for recent experiments where up to half the total mass of the FG nups has been deleted without abolishing transport. Our results suggest strategies for the creation of artificial nanomolecular sorting devices.},

	abstract = {Quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) provide a new analytical opportunity and prospect to characterize many environmental processes at solid/liquid interfaces, thanks to their almost real-time measurement of physicochemical changes on their quartz sensor. This work reviews the applications of QCMs in probing the interactions of organic molecules, nanomaterials (NMs) and microbes with solid surfaces. These interfacial interactions are relevant to critical environmental processes such as biofilm formation, fate and transport of NMs, fouling in engineering systems and antifouling practices. The high sensitivity, real-time monitoring, and simultaneous frequency and dissipation measurements make QCM-D a unique technique that helps reveal the interaction mechanisms for the abovementioned processes (e.g., driving forces, affinity, kinetics, and the interplay between surface chemistry and solution chemistry). On the other hand, QCM measurement is nonselective and spatially-dependent. Thus, caution should be taken during data analysis and interpretation, and it is necessary to cross-validate the results using complementary information from other techniques for more quantitative and accurate interpretation. This review summarizes the general methodologies for collecting and analyzing raw QCM data, as well as for evaluating the associated uncertainties. It serves to help researchers gain deeper insights into the fundamentals and applications of QCMs, and provides new perspectives on future research directions.},

	abstract = {Natively unfolded phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat domains are alleged to form the physical constituents of the selective barrier-gate in nuclear pore complexes during nucleocytoplasmic transport. Presently, the biophysical mechanism behind the selective gate remains speculative because of a lack of information regarding the nanomechanical properties of the FG domains. In this work, we have applied the atomic force microscope to measure the mechanical response of individual and clusters of FG molecules. Single-molecule force spectroscopy reveals that FG molecules are unfolded and highly flexible. To provide insight into the selective gating mechanism, an experimental platform has been constructed to study the collective behavior of surface-tethered FG molecules at the nanoscale. Measurements indicate that the collective behavior of such FG molecules gives rise to an exponentially decaying long-range steric repulsive force. This finding indicates that the molecules are thermally mobile in an extended polymer brush-like conformation. This assertion is confirmed by observing that the brush-like conformation undergoes a reversible collapse transition in less polar solvent conditions. These findings reveal how FG-repeat domains may simultaneously function as an entropic barrier and a selective trap in the near-field interaction zone of nuclear pore complexes; i.e., selective gate.},

	abstract = {The gold–sulphur interface of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) was extensively studied some time ago. More recently tremendous progress has been made in the preparation and characterization of thiolate-protected gold clusters. In this feature article we address different properties of the two systems such as their structure, the mobility of the thiolates on the surface and other dynamical aspects, the chirality of the structures and characteristics related to it and their vibrational properties. SAMs and clusters are in the focus of different communities that typically use different experimental approaches to study the respective systems. However, it seems that the nature of the Au–S interfaces in the two cases is quite similar. Recent single crystal X-ray structures of thiolate-protected gold clusters reveal staple motifs characterized by gold ad-atoms sandwiched between two sulphur atoms. This finding contradicts older work on SAMs. However, newer studies on SAMs also reveal ad-atoms. Whether this finding can be generalized remains to be shown. In any case, more and more studies highlight the dynamic nature of the Au–S interface, both on flat surfaces and in clusters. At temperatures slightly above ambient thiolates migrate on the gold surface and on clusters. Evidence for desorption of thiolates at room temperature, at least under certain conditions, has been demonstrated for both systems. The adsorbed thiolate can lead to chirality at different lengths scales, which has been shown both on surfaces and for clusters. Chirality emerges from the organization of the thiolates as well as locally at the molecular level. Chirality can also be transferred from a chiral surface to an adsorbate, as evidenced by vibrational spectroscopy.},

As phi29 DNAP synthesizes DNA and functions like a motor to pull a single-stranded template through MspA, we observe well-resolved and reproducible ionic current levels with median durations of ∼28 ms and ionic current differences of up to 40 pA. Using six different DNA sequences with readable regions 42-53 nucleotides long, we record current traces that map to the known DNA sequences.

Single-channel recording of the translocation duration and current flow during traversal of individual polynucleotides yielded a unique pattern of events for each of the several polymers tested. Statistical data derived from this pattern of events demonstrate that in several cases a nanopore can distinguish between polynucleotides of similar length and composition that differ only in sequence. Studies of temperature effects on the translocation process show that translocation duration scales as approximately T(-2). A strong correlation exists between the temperature dependence of the event characteristics and the tendency of some polymers to form secondary structure. Because nanopores can rapidly discriminate and characterize unlabeled DNA molecules at low copy number, refinements of the experimental approach demonstrated here could eventually provide a low-cost high-throughput method of analyzing DNA polynucleotides.},

	abstract = {Strong external electric field can destabilize membranes and induce formation of pores thus increasing membrane permeability. The phenomenon is known as membrane electroporation, sometimes referred to also as dielectric breakdown or electropermeabilization. The structural changes involving rearrangement of the phospholipid bilayer presumably lead to the formation of aqueous pores, which increases the conductivity of the membrane and its permeability to water-soluble molecules which otherwise are deprived of membrane transport mechanisms. This was shown in variety of experimental conditions, on artificial membranes such as planar lipid bilayers and vesicles, as well as on biological cells in vitro and in vivo. While studies of electroporation on artificial lipid bilayers enabled characterization of the biophysical processes, electroporation of biological cells led to the development of numerous biomedical applications. Namely, cell electroporation increases membrane permeability to otherwise nonpermeant molecules, which allows different biological and medical applications including transfer of genes (electrogene transfer), transdermal drug delivery and electrochemotherapy of tumors. In general, the key parameter for electroporation is the induced transmembrane voltage generated by an external electric field due to the difference in the electric properties of the membrane and the external medium, known as Maxwell-Wagner polarization. It was also shown that pore formation and the effectiveness of cell electroporation depend on parameters of electric pulses like number, duration, repetition frequency and electric field strength, where the later is the crucial parameter since increased transmembrane transport due to electroporation is only observed above a certain threshold field. Two main theoretical approaches were developed to describe electroporation. The electromechanical approach considers membranes as elastic or viscoelastic bodies, and applying principles of electrostatics and elasticity predict membrane rupture above critical membrane voltage. A conceptually different approach describing formation and expansion of pores is based on energy consideration; it is assumed that external electric field reduces the free energy barrier for formation of hydrophilic pores due to lower polarization energy of water in the pores compared to the membrane. Combined with stochastic mechanism of pores expansion it can describe experimental data of bilayer membranes. Still, the molecular mechanisms of pore formation and stabilization during electroporation are not fully understood and rigorous experimental conformation of different theories is still lacking. The focus of this chapter is to review experimental and theoretical data in the field of electroporation and to connect biophysical aspects of the process with the phenomenological experimental observations obtained on planar lipid bilayers, vesicles and cells. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

	abstract = {Translocation through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a large transporter spanning the nuclear envelope, is a passive, diffusion-driven process, paradoxically enhanced by binding. To account for this mystery, several models have been suggested. However, recent experiments with modified NPCs make reconsideration necessary. Here, we suggest that nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) such as the karyopherins, in accordance with their peculiar boat-like structure, act as nanoscopic ferries transporting cargos through the NPC by sliding on a surface of phenylalanine glycine (FG) motifs. The dense array of FG motifs that covers the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC is thought to continue on the wall of the large channel permeating the central framework of the NPC and on parts of the nuclear filaments to yield a coherent FG surface. Nuclear transport receptors are assumed to bind to the FG surface at filaments or at the channel entrance and then to rapidly search the FG surface by a two-dimensional random walk for the channel exit where they are released. The passage of neutral molecules is restricted to a narrow tube in the center of the central channel by a loose network of peptide chains. The model features virtual gating, is compatible with but not dependent on FG affinity gradients and tolerates deletions and transpositions of FG motifs. Implications of the model are discussed and tests are suggested.},

Currently, there is no clear picture of the overall structure formed by this collection of proteins within the pore, primarily due to their disordered nature. We perform coarse-grained simulations of both individual nucleoporins and grafted rings of nups mimicking the in vivo geometry of the NPC and supplement this with polymer brush modeling. Our results indicate that different regions or blocks of an individual NPC protein can have distinctly different forms of disorder and that this property appears to be a conserved functional feature. Furthermore, this block structure at the individual protein level is critical to the formation of a unique higher-order polymer brush architecture that can exist in distinct morphologies depending on the effective interaction energy between the phenylalanine glycine (FG) domains of different nups. Because the interactions between FG domains may be modulated by certain forms of transport factors, our results indicate that transitions between brush morphologies could play an important role in regulating transport across the NPC, suggesting novel forms of gated transport across membrane pores with wide biomimetic applicability. {\textcopyright} 2014 Biophysical Society.},

With the capability of handling single DNA molecules, nanopore technology holds high promises to become speedier in sequencing at lower cost than what are achievable with the commercially available optics- or semiconductor-based massively parallelized technologies. Despite tremendous progress made with biological and solid-state nanopores, high error rates and large uncertainties persist with the sequencing results. Here, we employ a nano-disk model to quantitatively analyze the sequencing process by examining the variations of ionic current when a DNA strand translocates a nanopore. Our focus is placed on signal-boosting and noise-suppressing strategies in order to attain the single-nucleotide resolution. Apart from decreasing pore diameter and thickness, it is crucial to also reduce the translocation speed and facilitate a stepwise translocation. Our best-case scenario analysis points to severe challenges with employing plain nanopore technology, i.e., without recourse to any signal amplification strategy, in achieving sequencing with the desired single-nucleotide resolution. A conceptual approach based on strand synthesis in the nanopore of the translocating DNA from single-stranded to double-stranded is shown to yield a 10-fold signal amplification. Although it involves no advanced physics and is very simple in mathematics, this simple model captures the essence of nanopore sequencing and is useful in guiding the design and operation of nanopore sequencing.},

	abstract = {DNA sequencing using solid-state nanopores is, in part, impeded by the relatively high noise and low bandwidth of the current state-of-the-art translocation measurements. In this Letter, we measure the ion current noise through sub 10 nm thick Si3N4 nanopores at bandwidths up to 1 MHz. At these bandwidths, the input-referred current noise is dominated by the amplifier's voltage noise acting across the total capacitance at the amplifier input. By reducing the nanopore chip capacitance to the 1−5pF range by adding thick insulating layers to the chip surface, we are able to transition to a regime in which input-referred current noise (∼117−150 pArms at 1 MHz in 1 M KCl solution) is dominated by the effects of the input capacitance of the amplifier itself. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) reported here range from 15 to 20 at 1 MHz for dsDNA translocations through nanopores with diameters from 4 to 8 nm with applied voltages from 200 to 800 mV. Further advances in bandwidth and SNR will require new amplifier designs that reduce both input capacitance and input-referred amplifier noise.},

Their selectivity relies on a supramolecular assembly of natively unfolded nucleoporin domains containing phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-rich repeats (FG repeat domains), in a way that is at present poorly understood. We have developed ultrathin FG domain films that reproduce the mode of attachment and the density of FG repeats in NPCs, and that exhibit a thickness that corresponds to the nanoscopic dimensions of the native permeability barrier. By using a combination of biophysical characterization techniques, we quantified the binding of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) to such FG domain films and analysed how this binding affects the swelling behaviour and mechanical properties of the films. The results extend our understanding of the interaction of FG domain assemblies with NTRs and contribute important information to refine the model of transport across the permeability barrier.},

The underlying physical mechanism of the intriguing selectivity is still under debate. Here, we probe the transport of ions and transport receptors through biomimetic NPCs consisting of Nsp1 domains attached to the inner surface of solid-state nanopores. We examine both wildtype FG-domains and hydrophilic SG-mutants. FG-nanopores showed a clear selectivity as transport receptors can translocate across the pore whereas other proteins cannot. SG mutant pores lack such selectivity. To unravel this striking difference, we present coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations that reveal that FG-pores exhibit a high-density, nonuniform protein distribution, in contrast to a uniform and significantly less-dense protein distribution in the SG-mutant. We conclude that the sequence-dependent density distribution of disordered proteins inside the NPC plays a key role for its conductivity and selective permeability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Polymer brushes are widely used as surface coatings for various inert, functional, or responsive interfaces. If the polymer can alter its protonation state (a polyelectrolyte (PE)), the brush can switch between a collapsed and swollen state with pH, which enables applications such as nanoscale actuators. However, changes in brush height as the polymer alters its charge state are not straightforward to measure accurately. Here, we show how surface plasmon resonance can be used to determine the thickness of PE brushes both in their charged and neutral states. We use different methods to measure the heights of brushes consisting of poly(acrylic acid) and the polybasic poly(2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate), both prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization. We find polymers in solution that can act as refractive index probes, which do not interact with the grafted polyelectrolytes, thus providing an "exclusion height" of the brush. Importantly, the angular reflection spectrum can be used to directly identify if a probe is indeed noninteracting. Furthermore, using different noninteracting probes results in small but significant changes (∼10{\%}) in the exclusion height as long as the probe is reasonably large (approximately {\textgreater}2 kg/mol). These differences cannot be attributed to probe charge. Data from multiple brushes show that the relative height increase (at physiological ionic strength), i.e., the "collapse ratio" upon charging due to pH alterations, increases with the absolute brush height. In addition, we show that the plasmonic response to the pH switching of the polyelectrolyte brush is opposite to the response of hydrophilic polymer brushes collapsing at the lower critical solution temperature. This phenomenon is explained by an increase in refractometric constant upon charging. Our study shows that surface plasmon resonance is an excellent tool for characterizing polyelectrolyte brushes and provides useful insights into pH actuation not easily obtained by other methods.},

The amount of adsorbed APDMES is nearly twice the amount obtained when the same reaction is performed without the preadsorbed EDA or when monoamines such as propylamine or triethylamine are used instead of EDA. In,addition, the use of preadsorbed EDA leads to an increase in the number of chemisorbed APDMES with free aminopropyl groups extending from the surface. Preadsorbed monoamines such as triethylamine, pyridine, or propylamine do not alter the adsorbed amount or change the number of free amine groups extending from the surface because they are easily displaced from the surface by APDMES.

Although great attention has been given to the anomalous increase of the capacitance as the pore size approaches the ionic dimensions, there remains a lack of full comprehension of the size dependence of the capacitance in nanopores. Here we predict from a classical density functional theory that the capacitance of an ionic-liquid electrolyte inside a nanopore oscillates with a decaying envelope as the pore size increases. The oscillatory behavior can be attributed to the interference of the overlapping electric double layers (EDLs); namely, the maxima in capacitance appear when superposition of the two EDLs is most constructive. The theoretical prediction agrees well with the experiment when the pore size is less than twice the ionic diameter. Confirmation of the entire oscillatory spectrum invites future experiments with a precise control of the pore size from micro- to mesoscales.},

These pores afforded: i), stable measurements at transmembrane voltages up to 460 mV; ii), recordings at low noise levels (0.4 pA rms at 4.3 kHz bandwidth); iii), recordings at high effective bandwidth (10.7 kHz); and iv), formation of multiple planar lipid bilayers in parallel. Microfabricated pores in films of Teflon AF made it possible to examine, experimentally and theoretically, the influence of the pore diameter on the current noise in planar bilayer recordings. Reducing the pore diameter below 40 $\mu$m mainly increased the stability of the planar bilayers, but had only a small effect on the level of the current noise. The low-noise properties of bilayer recordings on micropores in Teflon AF films were exploited to record the smallest conductance state of alamethicin (24 pS) at an unprecedentedly high bandwidth of 10.7 kHz.},

The QCM-D and ellipsometry data shows that, after adsorption to saturation of Mefp-1, cross-linking of the protein layer using NaIO4 transforms it from an extended (∼20 nm), water-rich, and hydrogel-like state to a much thinner (∼5 nm), compact, and less water-rich state. Furthermore, we show how quantitative data about the thickness, shear elastic modulus, and shear viscosity of the protein film can be obtained with the QCM-D technique, even beyond the Sauerbrey regime, if frequency (f) and energy dissipation (D) measurements measured at multiple harmonics are combined with theoretical simulations using a Voight-based viscoelastic model. The modeling result was confirmed by substituting H2O for D2O. As expected, the D2O substitution does not influence the actual adsorption behavior, but resulted in expected differences in the estimated effective density and shear viscosity. These results provide new insight and understanding about the adsorption kinetics and cross-linking behavior of Mefp-1. They also demonstrate how the above three techniques complement each other for biomolecule adsorption studies.},

The nanopore zeta potential zeta(pore) and the protein zeta potential zeta(protein) are measured independently as a function of solution pH. Our results reveal that electroosmotic transport may enhance or dominate and reverse electrophoretic transport in nanopores. The translocation behavior is rationalized by accounting for the charging states of the protein and the pore, respectively; the resulting translocation direction can be predicted according to the difference in zeta potentials, zeta(protein) - zeta(pore). When electrophoresis and electroosmosis cancel each other out, diffusion becomes an effective (and bias-independent) mechanism which facilitates protein transport across the pore at a significant rate.},

Tethered within each NPC lie numerous intrinsically disordered proteins known as FG nucleoporins (FG Nups) that are central to this process. Over two decades of investigation has converged on a view that a barrier mechanism consisting of FG Nups rejects non-specific macromolecules while promoting the speed and selectivity of karyopherin (Kaps) receptors (and their cargoes). Yet, the number of NPCs in the cell is exceedingly small compared to the number of Kaps, so that in fact there is a high likelihood the pores are always populated by Kaps. Here, we contemplate a view where Kaps actively participate in regulating the selectivity and speed of transport through NPCs. This so-called “Kap-centric” control of the NPC accounts for Kaps as essential barrier reinforcements that play a prerequisite role in facilitating fast transport kinetics. Importantly, Kap-centric control reconciles both mechanistic and kinetic requirements of the NPC, and in so doing potentially resolves incoherent aspects of FG-centric models. On this basis, we surmise that Kaps prime the NPC for nucleocytoplasmic transport by fine-tuning the NPC microenvironment according to the functional needs of the cell.},

	abstract = {Internal membrane bound structures sequester all genetic material in eukaryotic cells. The most prominent of these structures is the nucleus, which is bounded by a double membrane termed the nuclear envelope (NE). Though this NE separates the nucleoplasm and genetic material within the nucleus from the surrounding cytoplasm, it is studded throughout with portals called nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The NPC is a highly selective, bidirectional transporter for a tremendous range of protein and ribonucleoprotein cargoes. All the while the NPC must prevent the passage of nonspecific macromolecules, yet allow the free diffusion of water, sugars, and ions. These many types of nuclear transport are regulated at multiple stages, and the NPC carries binding sites for many of the proteins that modulate and modify the cargoes as they pass across the NE. Assembly, maintenance, and repair of the NPC must somehow occur while maintaining the integrity of the NE. Finally, the NPC appears to be an anchor for localization of many nuclear processes, including gene activation and cell cycle regulation. All these requirements demonstrate the complex design of the NPC and the integral role it plays in key cellular processes.},

In contrast, hydrophilic pore-containing molecules, such as DNA origami, have been shown to require chemical modification to favor insertion into a lipid environment. In this work, we describe a strategy for inserting polar proteins with an inner pore into lipid membranes, focusing here on a circular 12-subunit assembly of the thermophage G20c portal protein. X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, molecular dynamics, and thermal/chaotrope denaturation experiments all find the G20c portal protein to have a highly stable structure, favorable for nanopore sensing applications. Porphyrin conjugation to a cysteine mutant in the protein facilitates the protein's insertion into lipid bilayers, allowing us to probe ion transport through the pore. Finally, we probed the portal interior size and shape using a series of cyclodextrins of varying sizes, revealing asymmetric transport that possibly originates from the portal's DNA-ratchet function.},

	abstract = {The capsid of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) plays a pivotal role in viral nuclear import, but the mechanism by which the viral core passages the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is poorly understood. Here, we use DNA-origami mimics of the NPC, termed NuPODs (NucleoPorins Organized by DNA), to reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of HIV-1 capsid nuclear entry. We found that trimeric interface formed via three capsid protein hexamers is targeted by a triple-arginine (RRR) motif but not the canonical phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif of NUP153. As NUP153 is located on the nuclear face of the NPC, this result implies that the assembled capsid must cross the NPC in vivo. This hypothesis is corroborated by our observations of tubular capsid assemblies penetrating through NUP153 NuPODs. NUP153 prefers to bind highly curved capsid assemblies including those found at the tips of viral cores, thereby facilitating capsid insertion into the NPC. Furthermore, a balance of capsid stabilization by NUP153 and deformation by CPSF6, along with other cellular factors, may allow for the intact capsid to pass NPCs of various sizes. The NuPOD system serves as a unique tool for unraveling the previously elusive mechanisms of nuclear import of HIV-1 and other viruses.},

In vegetative Dictyostelium cells, GFP molecules experience a 3.6-fold reduction of their translational mobility relative to dilute aqueous solutions. In disrupting the actin filamentous network using latrunculin-A, the intact actin cytoskeletal network is shown to contribute an effective viscosity of 1.36 cP, which accounts for 53{\%} of the restrained molecular diffusion of GFP. The remaining 47{\%} of hindered protein motions is ascribed to other mechanical barriers and the viscosity of the cell liquid. A direct correlation between the density of the actin network and its limiting action on protein diffusion is furthermore established from measurements under different osmotic conditions. In highly locomotive polarized cells, the obstructing effect of the actin filamentous network is seen to decline to 0.46 cP in the non-cortical regions of the cell. Our results indicate that the meshwork of actin filaments constitutes the primary mechanical barrier for protein diffusion and that any noticeable reorganization of the network is accompanied by altered intracellular protein mobility.},

Although results were comparable to those of previous reports, the existence of previously overlooked mass transport limitations was revealed. Additional experiments with a loss-of-interaction mutant variant demonstrated the existence of additional physical events and an uncharacterized binding mode.

However, the more stochastic the nature of such biomolecular dynamics, the harder it becomes to distinguish them from AFM measurement noise. Rapid, stochastic dynamics are inherent to biological systems comprising intrinsically disordered proteins. One role of such proteins is in the formation of the transport barrier of the nuclear pore complex (NPC): the selective gateway for macromolecular traffic entering or exiting the nucleus. Here, we use AFM to observe the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins from two systems: the transport barrier of native NPCs and the transport barrier of a mimetic NPC made using a DNA origami scaffold. Analyzing data recorded with 50−200 ms temporal resolution, we highlight the importance of drift correction and appropriate baseline measurements in such experiments. In addition, we describe an autocorrelation analysis to quantify time scales of observed dynamics and to assess their veracityan analysis protocol that lends itself to the quantification of stochastic fluctuations in other biomolecular systems. The results reveal the surprisingly slow rate of stochastic, collective transitions inside mimetic NPCs, highlighting the importance of FG-nup cohesive interactions.},

Our new approach removes detected events and re-creates an ideal event-free baseline subsequently used to recalculate the local baseline. Iterative operation of this algorithm causes both the moving average of the baseline current and its standard deviation to converge to their correct values. We explain different approaches to selecting events and building event populations, and we show the value of keeping track of the changes in parameters, such as the event rate and the pore resistance, throughout the course of the experiment.

	abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are biological nanomachines that mediate the bidirectional traffic of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus in eukaryotic cells. This process involves numerous intrinsically disordered, barrier-forming proteins known as phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups) that are tethered inside each pore. The selective barrier mechanism has so far remained unresolved because the FG Nups have eluded direct structural analysis within NPCs. Here, high-speed atomic force microscopy is used to visualize the nanoscopic spatiotemporal dynamics of FG Nups inside Xenopus laevis oocyte NPCs at timescales of ∼100 ms. Our results show that the cytoplasmic orifice is circumscribed by highly flexible, dynamically fluctuating FG Nups that rapidly elongate and retract, consistent with the diffusive motion of tethered polypeptide chains. On this basis, intermingling FG Nups exhibit transient entanglements in the central channel, but do not cohere into a tightly crosslinked meshwork. Therefore, the basic functional form of the NPC barrier is comprised of highly dynamic FG Nups that manifest as a central plug or transporter when averaged in space and time.},

	abstract = {The molecular structure of the yeast nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the translocation of model particles have been studied with a molecular theory that accounts for the geometry of the pore and the sequence and anchoring position of the unfolded domains of the nucleoporin proteins (the FG-Nups), which control selective transport through the pore. The theory explicitly models the electrostatic, hydrophobic, steric, conformational, and acid-base properties of the FG-Nups. The electrostatic potential within the pore, which arises from the specific charge distribution of the FG-Nups, is predicted to be negative close to pore walls and positive along the pore axis. The positive electrostatic potential facilitates the translocation of negatively charged particles, and the free energy barrier for translocation decreases for increasing particle hydrophobicity. These results agree with the experimental observation that transport receptors that form complexes with hydrophilic/neutral or positively charged proteins to transport them through the NPC are both hydrophobic and strongly negatively charged. The molecular theory shows that the effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on the translocating potential are cooperative and nonequivalent due to the interaction-dependent reorganization of the FG-Nups in the presence of the translocating particle. The combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions can give rise to complex translocation potentials displaying a combination of wells and barriers, in contrast to the simple barrier potential observed for a hydrophilic/neutral translocating particle. This work demonstrates the importance of explicitly considering the amino acid sequence and hydrophobic, electrostatic, and steric interactions in understanding the translocation through the NPC.},

Tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin render the sodium channels impermeable to Na ions and to Li ions and probably prevent the opening of individual sodium channels when one toxin molecule binds to a channel. The apparent dissociation constant of the inhibitory complex is about 1 nM for the cationic forms of both toxins. The zwitter ionic forms are much less potent. On the other hand, DDT causes a fraction of the sodium channels that open during a depolarization to remain open for a longer time than is normal. The effect cannot be described as a specific change in sodium inactivation or as a specific change in sodium activation, for both processes continue to govern the opening of the sodium channels and neither process is able to close the channels. The effects of DDT are very similar to those of veratrine.},

To explain this selectivity, a sieve structure of the permeability barrier has been proposed that is created through reversible cross-linking between Phe and Gly (FG)-rich nucleoporin repeats. According to this model, nuclear transport receptors overcome the size limit of the sieve and catalyze their own nuclear pore-passage by a competitive disruption of adjacent inter-repeat contacts, which transiently opens adjoining meshes. Here, we found that phenylalanine-mediated inter-repeat interactions indeed cross-link FG-repeat domains into elastic and reversible hydrogels.

The size of the sensing region in solid-state nanopores is determined by the size of the pore and the thickness of the pore membrane, so ultrathin membranes such as graphene and single-layer molybdenum disulphide could potentially offer the necessary spatial resolution for nanopore DNA sequencing. However, the fast translocation speeds (3,000-50,000ntms-1) of DNA molecules moving across such membranes limit their usability. Here, we show that a viscosity gradient system based on room-temperature ionic liquids can be used to control the dynamics of DNA translocation through MoS 2 nanopores. The approach can be used to statistically detect all four types of nucleotide, which are identified according to current signatures recorded during their transient residence in the narrow orifice of the atomically thin MoS 2 nanopore. Our technique, which exploits the high viscosity of room-temperature ionic liquids, provides optimal single nucleotide translocation speeds for DNA sequencing, while maintaining a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 10.},

A quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was used to study the effect of particle surface coatings and water chemistry on the deposition of commercial QDs onto Al2O3. Two carboxylated QDs (CdSe and CdTe) with different surface coatings were compared with two model nanoparticles: sulfate-functionalized (sPL) and carboxyl-modified (cPL) polystyrene latex. Deposition rates were assessed over a range of ionic strengths (IS) in simple electrolyte (KCl) and in electrolyte supplemented with two organic molecules found in natural waters; namely, humic acid and rhamnolipid. The Al2O3 collector used here is selected to be representative of oxide patches found on the surface of aquifer or filter grains. Deposition studies showed that ENP deposition rates on bare Al2O3 generally decreased with increasing salt concentration, with the exception of the polyacrylic-acid (PAA) coated CdTe QD which exhibited unique deposition behavior due to changes in the conformation of the PAA coating. QD deposition rates on bare Al2O3 were approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than those of the polystyrene latex nanoparticles, likely as a result of steric stabilization imparted by the QD surface coatings. Adsorption of humic acid or rhamnolipid on the Al2O3 surface resulted in charge reversal of the collector and subsequent reduction in the deposition rates of all ENPs. Moreover, the ratio of the two QCM-D output parameters, frequency and dissipation, revealed key structural information of the ENP-collector interface; namely, on bare Al2O3, the latex particles were rigidly attached as compared to the more loosely attached QDs. This study emphasizes the importance of considering the nature of ENP coatings as well as organic molecule adsorption onto particle and collector surfaces to avoid underestimating ENP mobility in natural and engineered aquatic environments.},

Current FG-centric views reason that selective Kap translocation is promoted by alterations in the barrier-like FG Nup conformations. However, the strong binding of Kaps with the FG Nups due to avidity contradicts rapid Kap translocation in vivo. Here, using surface plasmon resonance, we innovate a means to correlate in situ mechanistic (molecular occupancy and conformational changes) with equilibrium (binding affinity) and kinetic (multivalent binding kinetics) aspects of Karyopherin$\beta$1 (Kap$\beta$1) binding to four different FG Nups. A general feature of the FxFG domains of Nup214, Nup62, and Nup153 is their capacity to extend and accommodate large numbers of Kap$\beta$1 molecules at physiological Kap$\beta$1 concentrations. A notable exception is the GLFG domain of Nup98, which forms a partially penetrable cohesive layer. Interestingly, we find that a slowly exchanging Kap$\beta$1 phase forms an integral constituent within the FG Nups that coexists with a fast phase, which dominates transport kinetics due to limited binding with the pre-occupied FG Nups at physiological Kap$\beta$1 concentrations. Altogether, our data reveal an emergent Kap-centric barrier mechanism that may underlie mechanistic and kinetic control in the nuclear pore complex. {\textcopyright} 2014 Biophysical Society.},

	abstract = {Ion transporters in Nature exhibit a wealth of complex transport properties such as voltage gating, activation, and mechanosensitive behavior. When combined, such processes result in advanced ionic machines achieving active ion transport, high selectivity, or signal processing. On the artificial side, there has been much recent progress in the design and study of transport in ionic channels, but mimicking the advanced functionalities of ion transporters remains as yet out of reach. A prerequisite is the development of ionic responses sensitive to external stimuli. In the present work, we report a counterintuitive and highly nonlinear coupling between electric and pressure-driven transport in a conical nanopore, manifesting as a strong pressure dependence of the ionic conductance. This result is at odds with standard linear response theory and is akin to a mechanical transistor functionality. We fully rationalize this behavior on the basis of the coupled electrohydrodynamics in the conical pore by extending the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes framework. The model is shown to capture the subtle mechanical balance occurring within an extended spatially charged zone in the nanopore. The pronounced sensitivity to mechanical forcing offers leads in tuning ion transport by mechanical stimuli. The results presented here provide a promising avenue for the design of tailored membrane functionalities.},

Further, MspA has a short and narrow channel constriction that is promising for DNA sequencing because it may enable improved characterization of short segments of a ssDNA molecule that is threaded through the pore. By eliminating the negative charge in the channel constriction, we designed and constructed an MspA mutant capable of electronically detecting and characterizing single molecules of ssDNA as they are electrophoretically driven through the pore. A second mutant with additional exchanges of negatively-charged residues for positively-charged residues in the vestibule region exhibited a factor of approximately 20 higher interaction rates, required only half as much voltage to observe interaction, and allowed ssDNA to reside in the vestibule approximately 100 times longer than the first mutant.

In this review, we discuss two potential applications of the nanopore sensors: First, we present a nanopore-based single-molecule DNA sequencing method that utilizes optical detection for massively parallel throughput. Second, we describe a method by which nanopores can be used as single-molecule genotyping tools. For DNA sequencing, the distinction among the four types of DNA nucleobases is achieved by employing a biochemical procedure for DNA expansion. In this approach, each nucleobase in each DNA strand is converted into one of four predefined unique 16-mers in a process that preserves the nucleobase sequence. The resulting converted strands are then hybridized to a library of four molecular beacons, each carrying a unique fluorophore tag, that are perfect complements to the 16-mers used for conversion. Solid-state nanopores are then used to sequentially remove these beacons, one after the other, leading to a series of photon bursts in four colors that can be optically detected. Single-molecule genotyping is achieved by tagging the DNA fragments with $\gamma$-modified synthetic peptide nucleic acid probes coupled to an electronic characterization of the complexes using solid-state nanopores. This method can be used to identify and differentiate genes with a high level of sequence similarity at the single-molecule level, but different pathology or response to treatment. We will illustrate this method by differentiating the pol gene for two highly similar human immunodeficiency virus subtypes, paving the way for a novel diagnostics platform for viral classification. {\textcopyright} 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

The detection principle relies on detecting small differences in the ionic current as biomolecules traverse the nanopore. A major bottleneck for the further progress of this technology is the noise that is present in the ionic current recordings, because it limits the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thereby the effective time resolution of the experiment. Here, we review the main types of noise at low and high frequencies and discuss the underlying physics. Moreover, we compare biological and solid-state nanopores in terms of the SNR, the important figure of merit, by measuring translocations of a short ssDNA through a selected set of nanopores under typical experimental conditions. We find that SiN x solid-state nanopores provide the highest SNR, due to the large currents at which they can be operated and the relatively low noise at high frequencies. However, the real game-changer for many applications is a controlled slowdown of the translocation speed, which for MspA was shown to increase the SNR {\textgreater} 160-fold. Finally, we discuss practical approaches for lowering the noise for optimal experimental performance and further development of the nanopore technology.},

The hole formation is treated as a nucleation process of a new phase in a two-dimensional system with short-range intermolecular forces. Free rupture and deliberate rupture (by $\alpha$-particles) of foam bilayers (Newtonian black films) are discussed. A comparison is made between the rupture of foam and emulsion bilayers. Experimental methods for obtaining foam and emulsion bilayers from thin liquid films are considered. Methods for investigating the stability and permeability of foam bilayers, which are based on a microscopic model allowing the use of amphiphile solutions with very low concentrations, are described. Experimental dependences of the lifetime of bilayers, the probability of observing the foam bilayer in a foam film, the gas permeability of bilayers, etc. on the concentration of amphiphile molecules in the solution are reported. The influence of temperature and external impact (e.g. $\alpha$-particle irradiation) have also been experimentally studied. A good agreement between theory and experiment is established, allowing determination of several characteristics of foam and emulsion bilayers obtained from ionics or non-ionics: the specific edge energy of bilayer holes, equilibrium surfactant concentration below which the bilayer is thermodynamically metastable, work for the formation of a nucleus hole, number of vacancies in the nucleus hole, coefficient of gas diffusion through the bilayer, etc. On the basis of the effect of temperature on the rupture of foam bilayers the binding energy of a surfactant molecule in the bilayer is determined. The adsorption isotherm of surfactant vacancies in the foam bilayer is obtained which shows a first-order phase transition. Some applications to scientific, technological and medical problems are considered. The foam bilayer is used as a model for investigating short-range forces in biological structures, the interaction between membranes and cell fusion. It is also shown that the foam bilayer is a suitable model for studying the alveolar surface and stability. On that basis a clinical diagnostic method is developed for assessment of the human foetal lung maturity. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

	abstract = {We describe a novel single molecule nanopore-based sequencing by synthesis (Nano-SBS) strategy that can accurately distinguish four bases by detecting 4 different sized tags released from 5'-phosphate-modified nucleotides. The basic principle is as follows. As each nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA strand during the polymerase reaction, its tag is released and enters a nanopore in release order. This produces a unique ionic current blockade signature due to the tag's distinct chemical structure, thereby determining DNA sequence electronically at single molecule level with single base resolution. As proof of principle, we attached four different length PEG-coumarin tags to the terminal phosphate of 2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-tetraphosphate. We demonstrate efficient, accurate incorporation of the nucleotide analogs during the polymerase reaction, and excellent discrimination among the four tags based on nanopore ionic currents. This approach coupled with polymerase attached to the nanopores in an array format should yield a single-molecule electronic Nano-SBS platform.},

Consisting of only eight strands, our DNA nanostructure spontaneously inserts into biological membranes by forming a toroidal pore that connects the membrane's inner and outer leaflets. The membrane insertion catalyzes spontaneous transport of lipid molecules between the bilayer leaflets, rapidly equilibrating the lipid composition. Through a combination of microscopic simulations and fluorescence microscopy we find the lipid transport rate catalyzed by the DNA nanostructure exceeds 107 molecules per second, which is three orders of magnitude higher than the rate of lipid transport catalyzed by biological enzymes. Furthermore, we show that our DNA-based enzyme can control the composition of human cell membranes, which opens new avenues for applications of membrane-interacting DNA systems in medicine.},

Current FG-centric views reason that selective Kap translocation is promoted by alterations in the barrier-like FG Nup conformations. However, the strong binding of Kaps with the FG Nups due to avidity contradicts rapid Kap translocation in vivo. Here, using surface plasmon resonance, we innovate a means to correlate in situ mechanistic (molecular occupancy and conformational changes) with equilibrium (binding affinity) and kinetic (multivalent binding kinetics) aspects of Karyopherin$\beta$1 (Kap$\beta$1) binding to four different FG Nups. A general feature of the FxFG domains of Nup214, Nup62, and Nup153 is their capacity to extend and accommodate large numbers of Kap$\beta$1 molecules at physiological Kap$\beta$1 concentrations. A notable exception is the GLFG domain of Nup98, which forms a partially penetrable cohesive layer. Interestingly, we find that a slowly exchanging Kap$\beta$1 phase forms an integral constituent within the FG Nups that coexists with a fast phase, which dominates transport kinetics due to limited binding with the pre-occupied FG Nups at physiological Kap$\beta$1 concentrations. Altogether, our data reveal an emergent Kap-centric barrier mechanism that may underlie mechanistic and kinetic control in the nuclear pore complex. {\textcopyright} 2014 Biophysical Society.},

Here, we show that highly multiplexed sensing of single molecules can be achieved with solid-state nanopores by using digitally encoded DNA nanostructures. Based on the principles of DNA origami, we designed a library of DNA nanostructures in which each member contains a unique barcode; each bit in the barcode is signalled by the presence or absence of multiple DNA dumbbell hairpins. We show that a 3-bit barcode can be assigned with 94{\%} accuracy by electrophoretically driving the DNA structures through a solid-state nanopore. Select members of the library were then functionalized to detect a single, specific antibody through antigen presentation at designed positions on the DNA. This allows us to simultaneously detect four different antibodies of the same isotype at nanomolar concentration levels.},

	abstract = {Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) are key cellular transporter that control nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotic cells, but its transport mechanism is still not understood. The centerpiece of NPC transport is the assembly of intrinsically disordered polypeptides, known as FG nucleoporins, lining its passageway. Their conformations and collective dynamics during transport are difficult to assess in vivo. In vitro investigations provide partially conflicting results, lending support to different models of transport, which invoke various conformational transitions of the FG nucleoporins induced by the cargo-carrying transport proteins. We show that the spatial organization of FG nucleoporin assemblies with the transport proteins can be understood within a first principles biophysical model with a minimal number of key physical variables, such as the average protein interaction strengths and spatial densities. These results address some of the outstanding controversies and suggest how molecularly divergent NPCs in different species can perform essentially the same function.Animal, plant and fungal cells contain a structure called the nucleus, inside which the genetic material of the cell is stored. For the cell to work properly, certain proteins and other molecules need to be able to enter and exit the nucleus. This transport is carried out by pore-like molecular “devices” known as Nuclear Pore Complexes, whose architecture and mode of operation are unique among cellular transporters.Nuclear Pore Complexes are charged with a daunting task of deciding which of the hundreds of molecules it conducts per second should go through and which should not. Small molecules can pass freely through Nuclear Pore Complexes. However, larger molecules can only pass through the pore efficiently if they are bound to specialized transport proteins that interact with the proteins – called FG nucleoporins – that line the pore. A unique feature of the FG nucleoporins is that, unlike typical proteins, they do not have a defined three-dimensional structure. Instead, they form a soft and pliable lining inside the Nuclear Pore Complex passageway.Exactly how interacting with transport proteins affects the structure and spatial arrangements of the FG nucleoporins in a way that allows them to control transport is not well understood. This is in part because existing experimental techniques are unable to study the structures of the FG nucleoporins in enough detail to track how they change during transport. The complexity and the diversity of the FG nucleoporins also make them difficult to model in detail.Vovk, Gu et al. have developed a theoretical model that is based on just three basic physical properties of the FG nucleoporins – their flexibility, their ability to interact with each other, and their binding with the transport proteins. Future work can refine the model by incorporating further molecular details about the interactions between FG nucleoporins and transport proteins.The predictions made by this simple model agree well with experimental results in a wide range of situations – from single molecules to complex spatial assemblies. They also explain why some of the experimental results appear to contradict each other and suggest how several outstanding controversies in the field can be reconciled. Because the model invokes only fundamental physical principles of FG nucleoporin assemblies, it shows that some of their general properties do not depend on the exact conditions. In particular, this might shed light on why Nuclear Pore Complexes in different organisms perform essentially the same function, although the details of their molecular structure may differ. This also suggests how the FG nucleoporins can be manipulated to build artificial devices based on the same principles.},

We describe the obtained "QCM-D mass", which is weighted over surface area, by a general particle height distribution equation that can be used to determine the average particle diameter of a distribution of particles deposited on the QCM-D surface. Because the particle height distribution equation can be used for any particle geometry and surface packing geometry, it is described how the QCM-D can also be used to study the orientation of deposited nonspherical particles. Herein, the mean nanoparticle sizes obtained by QCM-D were generally in closer agreement with the primary particle size determined by TEM than with the sizes obtained by DLS, suggesting that primarily smaller particles within the particle population deposited on the sensor surface.

A selective permeability barrier that arises from a supramolecular assembly of intrinsically unfolded nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine dipeptides (FG domains) fills the nuclear pore.

To understand the functional roles of cohesive interactions, we studied monolayers of end-grafted FG domains as a bottom-up nanoscale model system of the permeability barrier. Based on detailed physicochemical analysis of the model films and comparison of the data with polymer theory, we propose that cohesiveness is tuned to promote rapid assembly of the permeability barrier and to generate a stable and compact pore-filling meshwork with a small mesh size.

While these technologies have yielded a wealth of data, such studies still leave a significant gap between top-down experiments on live cells and bottom-up in vitro single-molecule studies of DNA-protein interactions. Here, we introduce "genome-in-a-box"(GenBox) as an alternative in vitro approach to build and study chromosomes, which bridges this gap. The concept is to assemble a chromosome from the bottom up by taking deproteinated genome-sized DNA isolated from live cells and subsequently add purified DNA-organizing elements, followed by encapsulation in cell-sized containers using microfluidics. Grounded in the rationale of synthetic cell research, the approach would enable to experimentally study emergent effects at the global genome level that arise from the collective action of local DNA-structuring elements. We review the various DNA-structuring elements present in nature, from nucleoid-associated proteins and SMC complexes to phase separation and macromolecular crowders. Finally, we discuss how GenBox can contribute to several open questions on chromosome structure and dynamics.},

Our model shows that the cooperative effect of FG-pairing, specific spacer cohesion, and charge interaction leads to a remarkably elaborate gating structure inside the NPC. In particular, we find sequence-programmed “phase separation” between charge-rich and charge-poor regions, and a polarized electrostatic potential throughout the NPC.

However, their kinetic resolution does not yet approach that of patch-clamp recordings. To help understand the processes that determine the temporal resolution and noise level of single-channel Ca2+ fluorescence signals (SCCaFTs), we simulated the microdomains of Ca2+ ions and Ca2+-bound indicator dye that exist around the mouth of an open channel. Further, as an aid to development of improved optical techniques, we modeled the dependence of the amplitude and kinetics of SCCaFTs on parameters such as the imaging volume, the indicator concentration, affinity and mobility, and the presence of endogenous and exogenous Ca2+ buffers. The results indicate that under optimal conditions, including the use of confocal or total-internal reflection microscopy to image from sub-femtolitre volumes, SCCaFTs should resolve channel openings as brief as 1 ms with a signal-to-noise ratio {\textgreater}10. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

While several ground breaking studies of graphene-based nanopores for DNA analysis have been reported, all methods to date require a physical transfer of the graphene from its source of production onto an aperture support. The transfer process is slow and often leads to tears in the graphene that render many devices useless for nanopore measurements. In this work, we report a novel scalable approach for site-directed fabrication of pinhole-free graphene nanomembranes. Our approach yields high quality few-layer graphene nanomembranes produced in less than a day using a few steps that do not involve transfer. We highlight the functionality of these graphene devices by measuring DNA translocation through electron-beam fabricated nanopores in such membranes.},

	abstract = {Background: The ability to obtain long read lengths during DNA sequencing has several potentially important practical applications. Especially long read lengths have been reported using the Nanopore sequencing method, currently commercially available from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). However, early reports have demonstrated only limited levels of combined throughput and sequence accuracy. Recently, ONT released a new CsgG pore sequencing system as well as a 250b/s translocation chemistry with potential for improvements. Methods: We made use of such components on ONTs miniature ‘MinION' device and sequenced native genomic DNA obtained from the near haploid cancer cell line HAP1. Analysis of our data was performed utilising recently described computational tools tailored for nanopore/long-read sequencing outputs, and here we present our key findings. Results: From a single sequencing run, we obtained {\~{}}240,000 high-quality mapped reads, comprising a total of {\~{}}2.3 billion bases. A mean read length of 9.6kb and an N50 of {\~{}}17kb was achieved, while sequences mapped to reference with a mean identity of 85{\%}. Notably, we obtained {\~{}}68X coverage of the mitochondrial genome and were able to achieve a mean consensus identity of 99.8{\%} for sequenced mtDNA reads. Conclusions: With improved sequencing chemistries already released and higher-throughput instruments in the pipeline, this early study suggests that ONT CsgG-based sequencing may be a useful option for potential practical long-read applications with relevance to complex genomes.},

Large structures can also assemble efficiently from a few components by combining hierarchical assembly and symmetry, a strategy exemplified by viral capsids4. De novo protein design5-9 and RNA10,11 and DNA nanotechnology12-14 aim to mimic these capabilities, but the bottom-up construction of artificial structures with the dimensions and complexity of viruses and other subcellular components remains challenging. Here we show that natural assembly principles can be combined with the methods of DNA origami15-24 to produce gigadalton-scale structures with controlled sizes. DNA sequence information is used to encode the shapes of individual DNA origami building blocks, and the geometry and details of the interactions between these building blocks then control their copy numbers, positions and orientations within higher-order assemblies. We illustrate this strategy by creating planar rings of up to 350 nanometres in diameter and with atomic masses of up to 330 megadaltons, micrometre-long, thick tubes commensurate in size to some bacilli, and three-dimensional polyhedral assemblies with sizes of up to 1.2 gigadaltons and 450 nanometres in diameter. We achieve efficient assembly, with yields of up to 90 per cent, by using building blocks with validated structure and sufficient rigidity, and an accurate design with interaction motifs that ensure that hierarchical assembly is self-limiting and able to proceed in equilibrium to allow for error correction. We expect that our method, which enables the self-assembly of structures with sizes approaching that of viruses and cellular organelles, can readily be used to create a range of other complex structures with well defined sizes, by exploiting the modularity and high degree of addressability of the DNA origami building blocks used.},

A long-standing question of particular importance for electronics is whether 1/f noise is generated on the surface of electrical conductors or inside their volumes. Using high-quality graphene multilayers, we were able to directly address this fundamental problem of the noise origin. Unlike the thickness of metal or semiconductor films, the thickness of graphene multilayers can be continuously and uniformly varied all the way down to a single atomic layer of graphene—the actual surface. We found that 1/f noise becomes dominated by the volume noise when the thickness exceeds ∼7 atomic layers (∼2.5 nm). The 1/f noise is the surface phenomenon below this thickness. The obtained results are important for continuous downscaling of conventional electronics and for the proposed graphene applications in sensors and communications. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Institute of Physics},

While most of the structural elements of the NPC, i.e. nucleoporins (Nups), are well characterized, the exact transport mechanism is still under much debate. Many of the functional Nups are rich in phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats and are believed to play the key role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. We present a bioinformatics study conducted on more than a thousand FG Nups across 252 species. Our results reveal the regulatory role of polar residues and specific sequences of charged residues, named 'like charge regions' (LCRs), in the formation of the FG network at the center of the NPC. Positively charged LCRs prepare the environment for negatively charged cargo complexes and regulate the size of the FG network. The low number density of charged residues in these regions prevents FG domains from forming a relaxed coil structure. Our results highlight the significant role of polar interactions in FG network formation at the center of the NPC and demonstrate that the specific localization of LCRs, FG motifs, charged, and polar residues regulate the formation of the FG network at the center of the NPC.},

	abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) conduct massive transport mediated by shuttling nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), while keeping nuclear and cytoplasmic contents separated. The NPC barrier in Xenopus relies primarily on the intrinsically disordered FG domain of Nup98. We now observed that Nup98 FG domains of mammals, lancelets, insects, nematodes, fungi, plants, amoebas, ciliates, and excavates spontaneously and rapidly phase-separate from dilute (submicromolar) aqueous solutions into characteristic ‘FG particles'. This required neither sophisticated experimental conditions nor auxiliary eukaryotic factors. Instead, it occurred already during FG domain expression in bacteria. All Nup98 FG phases rejected inert macromolecules and yet allowed far larger NTR cargo complexes to rapidly enter. They even recapitulated the observations that large cargo-domains counteract NPC passage of NTR⋅cargo complexes, while cargo shielding and increased NTR⋅cargo surface-ratios override this inhibition. Their exquisite NPC-typical sorting selectivity and strong intrinsic assembly propensity suggest that Nup98 FG phases can form in authentic NPCs and indeed account for the permeability properties of the pore.Cells of eukaryotic species—which include plants, animals, and fungi—have a nucleus that harbours the organism's genome. Two membrane layers surround the nucleus and separate its contents from the cytoplasm, where proteins are made. This separation is essential for a correct interpretation of the genetic information. Yet, various molecules, such as proteins, need to move into or out of the nucleus for the cell to work properly. This transit has to occur without an uncontrolled mixing of the contents of the nucleus and the cytoplasm happening.Structures called nuclear pore complexes span the double membrane and allow material to be exchanged between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Small molecules can freely pass through these complexes, while larger molecules can only be transported when bound as “cargo” to so-called nuclear transport receptors. Nuclear pore complexes are large assemblies of proteins called nucleoporins. FG nucleoporins are special in that they contain regions with a repeating pattern of two amino acids, phenylalanine (‘F') and glycine (‘G'). These regions are called FG domains. They bind to nuclear transport receptors and have been suspected to form a barrier that decides which molecules may pass through the nuclear pore complex. Exactly how this control is exerted has been a matter of debate.Versions of a particular FG nucleoporin called Nup98 are found in all branches of eukaryotic life, i.e. in animals, fungi, plants, amoebas, and even in the evolutionarily most distant protozoans. When Schmidt and G{\"{o}}rlich dispersed small amounts of Nup98 FG domains in an aqueous solution, the domains rapidly attracted each other to form ‘FG particles', regardless of which species the proteins came from. These FG particles were so dense that they repelled ‘normal' macromolecules, yet they allowed nuclear transport receptors, along with their bound cargoes, to rapidly enter. Taken together, the work of Schmidt and G{\"{o}}rlich suggests that such FG particles form the transport barrier in nuclear pore complexes.Based on these findings, Schmidt and G{\"{o}}rlich refine a model where the FG domains form a mesh in the nuclear pore complexes that acts like a ‘smart sieve'. Smaller molecules can move through gaps in the meshwork, but larger molecules are hindered. Schmidt and G{\"{o}}rlich suggest that nuclear transport receptors help large molecules to move through nuclear pore complexes by ‘melting' the FG meshwork locally, creating a path for the molecule to move through. The reconstitution of these smart barriers in the laboratory will now allow researchers to analyse the process of receptor-mediated nuclear pore passage in unprecedented (mechanistic) detail.},

Akin to bubble blowing, an inner aqueous phase and a surrounding lipid-carrying 1-octanol phase is pinched off by outer fluid streams. Such hydrodynamic flow focusing results in double-emulsion droplets that spontaneously develop a side-connected 1-octanol pocket. Owing to interfacial energy minimization, the pocket splits off to yield fully assembled solvent-free liposomes within minutes. This solves the long-standing fundamental problem of prolonged presence of residual oil in the liposome bilayer. We demonstrate the unilamellarity of liposomes with functional $\alpha$-haemolysin protein pores in the membrane and validate the biocompatibility by inner leaflet localization of bacterial divisome proteins (FtsZ and ZipA).

Several systems are studied, namely 1), a bare bilayer, 2), a bilayer containing a peptide nanotube channel, and 3), a system with a peripheral DNA double strand. In all systems, the applied transmembrane electric fields (0.5 V.nm-1 and 1.0 V.nm-1) induce an electroporation of the lipid bilayer manifested by the formation of water wires and water channels across the membrane. The internal structures of the peptide nanotube assembly and that of the DNA strand are hardly modified under field. For system 2, no perturbation of the membrane is witnessed at the vicinity of the channel, which indicates that the interactions of the peptide with the nearby lipids stabilize the bilayer. For system 3, the DNA strand migrates to the interior of the membrane only after electroporation. Interestingly enough, switching of the external transmembrane potential in cases 1 and 2 for few nanoseconds is enough to allow for complete resealing and reconstitution of the bilayer. We provide evidence that the electric field induces a significant lateral stress on the bilayer, manifested by surface tensions of magnitudes in the order of 1 mN.m-1.

In addition, the review provides guidelines for its application in conjunction with the molecular dynamics software package GROMACS. We first lay out the rationale for designing CompEL as a method that models the driving force for ion permeation through channels the way it is established in cells, i.e., by electrochemical ion gradients across the membrane. This is followed by an outline of its implementation and a description of key settings and parameters helpful to users wishing to set up and conduct such simulations. In recent years, key mechanistic and biophysical insights have been obtained by employing the CompEL protocol to address a wide range of questions on ion channels and permeation. We summarize these recent findings on membrane proteins, which span a spectrum from highly ion-selective, narrow channels to wide diffusion pores. Finally we discuss the future potential of CompEL in light of its limitations and strengths. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane Proteins edited by J.C. Gumbart and Sergei Noskov.},

The isoelectric points range from mildly basic in the case of Al2O3 sensors (IEP = 8.7) to moderately acidic for Au (5.2) and SiO2 (3.9), to acidic for Ag (3.2) and Ti (2.9). In general, the values reported here are indicative of inherent surface oxides. A demonstration of the effect of the surface isoelectric point on the packing efficiency of thin mucin films is provided for gold and silica QCM sensors. It is determined that mucin layers on both substrates achieve a maximum and equal layer density of ∼3500 kg/m(3) at the corresponding IEP of either QCM sensor. This implies that mucin film packing is dependent upon short-range electrostatic interactions at the sensor surface.},

The movement of a domain is treated as the motion of an elastically bound Brownian particle, which is described by the Langevin equation. The current-noise spectrum predicted by this model is given by a sum of Lorentzians; it agrees with the observed spectrum when it is assumed that only the slowest process can be resolved in the experiment. The large value of the friction coefficient, which is obtained from the corner frequency, indicates that domain motion is restricted mainly by peptide-peptide interactions. {\textcopyright} 1985, The Biophysical Society.

	abstract = {Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) is a small, homodimeric protein that binds to both RanGDP and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins, such as yeast Nsp1p and vertebrate p62. NTF2 is required for efficient nuclear protein import and has been shown to mediate the nuclear import of RanGDP. We have used the crystal structures of rat NTF2 and its complex with RanGDP to design a mutant, W7A-NTF2, in which the affinity for xFxFG-repeat nucleoporins is reduced while wild-type binding to RanGDP is retained. The 2.5 {\AA} resolution crystal structure of W7A-NTF2 is virtually superimposable upon the wild-type protein structure, indicating that the mutation had not introduced a more general conformational change. Therefore, our data suggest that the exposed side-chain of residue 7 is crucial to the interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins. Consistent with its reduced affinity for xFxFG nucleoporins, fluorescently labelled W7A-NTF2 binds less strongly to the nuclear envelope of permeabilized cultured cells than wild-type NTF2 and, when microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, colloidal gold coated with W7A-NTF2 binds less strongly to the central channel of nuclear pore complexes than wild-type NTF2-coated gold. Significantly, W7A-NTF2 only weakly stimulated the nuclear import of fluorescein-labelled RanGDP, providing direct evidence that an interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins is required to mediate the nuclear import of RanGDP.},

KGaA, Weinheim  The ability to quickly and reliably fabricate nanoscale pore arrays in ultra-thin membranes such as silicon nitride (Si x N) is extremely important for the growing field of nanopore biosensing. Laser-based etching of thin Si x N membranes immersed in aqueous solutions has recently been demonstrated as a method to produce stable functional pores. Herein, the principal mechanism governing material etching and pore formation using light is investigated. It is found that the process is extremely sensitive to the relative content of Si over N atoms in the amorphous membrane, produced by chemical vapor deposition. Commonly, Si x N membranes are made to be Si-rich to increase their mechanical stability, which substantially reduces the material's bandgap and increases the density of Si-dangling bonds. Hence, even minimal batch-to-batch variation may lead to remarkably different etch rates. It is shown that higher Si content results in orders of magnitude faster etching rates. This rate is further accelerated in an alkaline environment allowing on-demand controlled nanopore formation in about 10 s time even at low laser radiation intensities. These results highlight that photoactivation of the Si x N by the incident beam is critical to the chemical etching process and can be used to readily produce nanopore arrays at any specific location.},

In vitro methods to examine protein-protein interactions are generally categorized into two classes: in-solution and surface-based methods. Here, using the multivalent interactions involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport as a model system, we examined the utility of three surface-based methods in characterizing rapid interactions involving intrinsically disordered proteins: atomic force microscopy, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, and surface plasmon resonance. Although results were comparable to those of previous reports, the existence of previously overlooked mass transport limitations was revealed. Additional experiments with a loss-of-interaction mutant variant demonstrated the existence of additional physical events and an uncharacterized binding mode. These results suggest the binding events that take place on the surface are more complex than initially assumed, prompting a need for re-interpretation of previous data.},

We constructed 34 nm-wide 3D DNA origami rings and attached different numbers of NSP1, a model yeast FG-Nup, or NSP1-S, a hydrophilic mutant. Using (cryo) electron microscopy, we find that NSP1 forms denser cohesive networks inside the ring compared to NSP1-S. Consistent with this, the measured ionic conductance is lower for NSP1 than for NSP1-S. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal spatially varying protein densities and conductances in good agreement with the experiments.

Here we present experimental methods that directly integrate suspended lipid bilayers with high-bandwidth, low-noise transimpedance amplifiers based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (IC) technology to achieve bandwidths in excess of 500 kHz and microsecond temporal resolution. We use this CMOS-integrated bilayer system to study the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), a Ca 2+ -activated intracellular Ca 2+ -release channel located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. We are able to distinguish multiple closed states not evident with lower bandwidth recordings, suggesting the presence of an additional Ca 2+ binding site, distinct from the site responsible for activation. An extended beta distribution analysis of our high-bandwidth data can be used to infer closed state flicker events as fast as 35 ns. These events are in the range of single-file ion translocations. },

	abstract = {It has recently been recognized that solid-state nanopores in singleatomic- layer graphene membranes can be used to electronically detect and characterize single long charged polymer molecules. We have now fabricated nanopores in single-layer graphene that are closelymatched to the diameter of a double-strandedDNA molecule. Ionic current signals during electrophoretically driven translocation of DNA through these nanopores were experimentally explored and theoretically modeled. Our experiments show that these nanopores have unusually high sensitivity (0.65 nA/A) to extremely small changes in the translocating molecule's outer diameter. Such atomically short graphene nanopores can also resolve nanoscale-spaced molecular structures along the length of a polymer, but do so with greatest sensitivity only when the pore and molecule diameters are closely matched. Modeling confirms that our most closely matched pores have an inherent resolution of =0.6 nm along the length of the molecule.},

@article{Zivanov2018,
	abstract = {Here, we describe the third major release of relion. CPU-based vector acceleration has been added in addition to GPU support, which provides flexibility in use of resources and avoids memory limitations. Reference-free autopicking with Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering and execution of jobs from python allows non-interactive processing during acquisition, including 2D-classification, de novo model generation and 3D-classification. Perparticle refinement of CTF parameters and correction of estimated beam tilt provides higher-resolution reconstructions when particles are at different heights in the ice, and/or coma-free alignment has not been optimal. Ewald sphere curvature correction improves resolution for large particles. We illustrate these developments with publicly available data sets: together with a Bayesian approach to beam-induced motion correction it leads to resolution improvements of 0.2-0.7 {\AA} compared to previous relion versions.},

@article{Wong2007,
	abstract = {The authors have addressed theoretically the hydrodynamic effect on the translocation of DNA through nanopores. They consider the cases of nanopore surface charge being opposite to the charge of the translocating polymer. The authors show that, because of the high electric field across the nanopore in DNA translocation experiments, electro-osmotic flow is able to create an absorbing region comparable to the size of the polymer around the nanopore. Within this capturing region, the velocity gradient of the fluid flow is high enough for the polymer to undergo coil-stretch transition. The stretched conformation reduces the entropic barrier of translocation. The diffusion limited translocation rate is found to be proportional to the applied voltage. In the authors' theory, many experimental variables (electric field, surface potential, pore radius, dielectric constant, temperature, and salt concentration) appear through a single universal parameter. They have made quantitative predictions on the size of the adsorption region near the pore for the polymer and on the rate of translocation.},
